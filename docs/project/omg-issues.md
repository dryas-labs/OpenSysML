# Bugs in the OMG materials

One place to look for defects found in the OMG-published sources this
implementation consumes. This page records defects in the **vendored specification
libraries** (`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/`), in the **published example corpora**, and
in the **OMG pilot implementation** the differential is measured against, and in the
**PSSM test suite** the state-machine referee runs.

Each row quotes the vendored declaration verbatim so a reviewer can judge it
without opening the library, and names what OpenSysML implements instead. Every
divergence is also a row in [spec-compliance.md](spec-compliance.md).

| Library file | Declaration | What the vendored body says | What we implement | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Kernel Libraries/Kernel Function Library/NaturalFunctions.kerml` | `function '/'` | `function '/' specializes IntegerFunctions::'/' { in x: Natural[1]; in y: Natural[1]; return : Natural[1]; }` — a Natural quotient, which `7 / 2` cannot inhabit without truncation | the quotient of two whole numbers is a Rational, never normalised back to a whole number even when exact: `divisionResult` types `Natural/Natural` as `Rational`, and the runtime answers a Real (`runtime/eval.go` `evalArithmetic`) | The pilot's evaluator answers `LiteralRational 2.5` for `5 / 2` even when both operands are `Natural`-typed attributes — it dispatches on value kind, and a whole-number value divides through `RationalFunctions::'/'`, which `IntegerFunctions::'/'` specializes with `return : Rational[1]`. The declared `Natural[1]` return is unimplementable without truncating, which the reference does not do; the draft below asks which of the two the specification intends |
| `Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/MeasurementReferences.sysml`, `VectorCalculations.sysml` | `attribute def CoordinateFramePlacement`, `attribute def Rotation`, `calc def transform` | `origin specifies the location of the origin of the target frame as a vector in the source frame`; `basisDirections specifies the orientation of the target frame by specifying the directions of the respective basis vectors of the target frame via direction vectors in the source frame`; `transform` has no body — the text fixes what a placement *states* but not which way `transform` applies it, whether a direction vector's magnitude matters, or which axes an intrinsic rotation turns about | a placement maps target coordinates into source ones (`v_source = origin + B v_target`), so `transform(source→target)` applies the inverse `B⁻¹ (v − origin)`; basis directions are normalized; an intrinsic rotation turns about the axis as the earlier elements of the sequence moved it, an extrinsic one about the axis fixed in the source; a `NullTransformation` is the identity | The pinned pilot evaluates `transform` for no input, so the library text is the only authority and each reading is drafted below for clarification rather than asserted as the specification's |
| `Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/VectorCalculations.sysml` | `calc def inner`, `calc def norm` | `calc def inner :> VectorFunctions::inner { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : Number[1]; }` and `calc def norm :> VectorFunctions::norm { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : Number[1]; }` — a bare `Number`, where `QuantityCalculations::'*'`, `'/'` and `sqrt` over scalar quantities return `ScalarQuantityValue[1]`, so the norm of a length vector has no unit while the square root of a length squared keeps one | the declaration: `inner`, `norm` and `angle` of a vector quantity answer the `Number` computed over the vector's `num` components (`norm(⟨3.0, 4.0⟩ [m])` is `5.0`, `inner` is `25.0`), never a quantity, and a `Number` feature takes them; the unit is dropped by declaration (`runtime/vector_functions.go` `vectorInner`, `vectorNorm`) | The checker already types the calls by their declared `Number` return, so a runtime answering a quantity would disagree with it; the pinned pilot evaluates neither, so there is no reference answer to follow. Recorded as a library inconsistency for review, not as a defect OpenSysML corrects |
| `Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/VectorCalculations.sysml` | `calc def outer` | `calc def outer { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : VectorQuantityValue[1]; }` — a vector, where the outer product of two vectors of orders one is a tensor of order two (`TensorCalculations::'['` returns `TensorQuantityValue[1]` for exactly that shape) | nothing: `outer` is `ErrUnevaluableLibraryFunction` naming the declaration and its return type (`runtime/quantity_functions.go` `registerVectorCalculations`); the checker types a call by the declared `VectorQuantityValue` | No `VectorQuantityValue` holds an outer product, and answering a `TensorQuantityValue` would disagree with the checker and the declaration; the draft below asks for `return : TensorQuantityValue[1]` |
| `Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/TensorCalculations.sysml` | `calc def isUnitTensorQuantity` | `calc def isUnitTensorQuantity { in x : TensorQuantityValue[1]; return : Boolean[1]; }` — no body, and no statement of which tensor is the unit one beside `isUnitVectorQuantity` (a vector of norm one) | the identity of a square order-two tensor: `true` when every diagonal component is one and every other zero; a tensor of any other shape (a vector, a 2×3, an order three) is `ErrUnevaluableLibraryFunction` naming the shape it needs (`runtime/tensor_functions.go` `tensorIsUnit`) | The library names no unit tensor; the identity matrix is the one tensor with an established claim to the name, and it exists for square order two alone, so a reading over other shapes would be invented. Recorded so the reading can be checked against a future release that gives the calculation a body |
| `Domain Libraries/Geometry/ShapeItems.sysml` | `item def CuboidOrTriangularPrism` (`Cuboid`, `RectangularCuboid`, `Box`) | `item tfe [2] :> edges;` … `binding [1] bind [0..1] tf.edges = [0..1] tfe;` `binding [1] bind [0..1] ff.edges = [0..1] tfe;` — every named edge group and vertex group (`tfe`…`urre`, `tflv`…`brrv`) is valued only by bindings whose ends link *one unspecified* value each; and `item :>> vertices; assert constraint { size(vertices) == size(edges) }` beside `Quadrilateral`'s `item :>> vertices [8];` and `StructuredSpaceObject`'s `faces.vertices subsets vertices` | the groups and everything read through them (`box.tfe`, `box.tflv`, `box.tfe.length`, `box.vertices`) are the typed `ErrBindingEnd` naming the binding; the runtime never picks a member (`runtime/binding.go` `UndeterminedBindingError`) | No conjunction of the bindings, the `MatesWith` connections and the `size(...)` assertions identifies which of a face's four edges a group holds, so no evaluator can name `tfe`; and a `Cuboid`'s `vertices` cannot be both a superset of its six faces' 48 vertex objects and 24 long. The draft below records both |
| `Kernel Libraries/Kernel Data Type Library/Collections.kerml` | `UniqueCollection::elements`, `OrderedSet::elements`, `Map::elements`, `OrderedMap::elements` | `feature elements[0..*] :>> Collection::elements { doc /* Note: Redefinition of 'elements' is unique by default. */ }` over `feature elements[0..*] nonunique` — a redefinition stating neither `nonunique` nor `ordered`, whose only claim to uniqueness is the note | the four redefinitions are unique, as their notes say, and every collection under them (`Set`, `OrderedSet`, `Map`, `OrderedMap`, a model's `:>> elements` in one) inherits that; a redefinition anywhere else that states neither keyword takes the uniqueness of what it redefines (`semantics.Model.IsUnique`) | KerML 1.0 §7.3.4.4 gives the *default* only to a fresh or subsetting feature; a redefinition has "the same" values as the feature it redefines (§7.3.4.5), and the pinned pilot models it so — `'3dVectorQuantityValue'::num :>> num` and `CartesianSpatial3dCoordinateFrame::mRefs :>> mRefs` restate no keyword and the validator refuses to redefine either `nonunique` (`validateSubsettingUniquenessConformance`), while the library's own `mRefs default (SI::m, SI::m, SI::m)` and every `(0, 0, 1)` direction vector hold repeats it accepts. Reading every unstated redefinition as unique would make those defaults and vectors violations; reading it as inheriting makes `Set` and `Map` nonunique against the note. The note is the library's statement of intent, so it wins for these four declarations only |
| `Kernel Libraries/Kernel Function Library/SequenceFunctions.kerml` | `function includingAt` | `(seq->subsequence(1, index - 1), values, seq->subsequence(index + 1))` — the prefix before `index`, then the values, then the tail from `index + 1`, so the element **at** `index` is dropped from the result | insertion: the values are inserted before the 1-based `index`, the tail from that position shifts right, and the result is longer than `seq` by the values inserted. `index == size + 1` appends; any other index outside `1..size + 1` is `ErrIndexOutOfRange` (`runtime.builtinSequenceIncludingAt`) | The body contradicts the declarations around it in the same file. `excludingAt` is the operation that removes at an index, and the behavior pairs are additive/subtractive: `add` calls `including` as `remove` calls `excluding`, and `addAt` calls `includingAt` (`seq->includingAt(values, index)`) as `removeAt` calls `excludingAt`. A removing `includingAt` would leave the library with two ways to delete at an index and none to insert at one, and would make `addAt` remove. The vendored expression is an off-by-one slip in the tail: the insertion body is `(seq->subsequence(1, index - 1), values, seq->subsequence(index))` |

## `Collections::UniqueCollection::elements` and its kin — unique by a note, over a `nonunique` root

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Kernel Libraries/Kernel Data Type Library/Collections.kerml`:

```kerml
abstract datatype Collection {
    feature elements[0..*] nonunique { … }
}
abstract datatype UniqueCollection :> Collection {
    feature elements[0..*] :>> Collection::elements {
        doc
        /* Note: Redefinition of 'elements' is unique by default. */
    }
}
datatype OrderedSet :> OrderedCollection, UniqueCollection {
    feature elements[0..*] ordered :>> OrderedCollection::elements, UniqueCollection::elements {
        doc
        /* Note: Redefinition of elements is unique by default. */
    }
}
datatype Map :> Collection {
    feature elements: KeyValuePair[0..*] :>> Collection::elements {
        doc
        /* Note: Redefinition of elements is unique by default.*/
    }
}
datatype OrderedMap :> Map, OrderedCollection {
    feature elements: KeyValuePair[0..*] ordered :>> Map::elements, OrderedCollection::elements {
        doc
        /* Note: Redefinition of elements is unique by default. */
    }
}
```

KerML 1.0 §7.3.4.2 makes `isUnique` default to true ("the default is that the feature is unique";
`+isUnique : Boolean = true` in the §8.3.3.3.1 overview), and `nonunique` is the one piece of concrete syntax that sets it false
(`MultiplicityPart`, §8.2.4.3.1). §7.3.4.4 says what that default means under specialization —
"if the subsetted feature is non-unique, then the subsetting feature will still be unique by
default, unless specifically flagged as nonunique" — and the four notes above read that sentence
as applying to a redefinition too. The library is not consistent with that reading elsewhere:

- `Quantities::'3dVectorQuantityValue'` declares `:>> num : Real[3]` over
  `TensorQuantityValue::num : Number[1..*] ordered nonunique`, and every direction vector in the
  domain library and the geometry examples, `(0, 0, 1)` and the like, repeats a value.
- `MeasurementReferences::CartesianSpatial3dCoordinateFrame` declares `:>> mRefs : LengthUnit[3]`
  over `TensorMeasurementReference::mRefs : ScalarMeasurementReference[1..*] nonunique`, and the
  library's own `default (SI::m, SI::m, SI::m)` repeats one.

The pinned pilot (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0, release 2026-07) models both redefinitions as
**unique**: a model redefining either `nonunique` (`:>> mRefs nonunique = (m, m, m)`,
`:>> num nonunique = (0, 0, 1)`) is refused with `validateSubsettingUniquenessConformance`
("Subsetting/redefining feature cannot be nonunique if subsetted/redefined feature is unique"),
so no model author can opt out. The pilot never checks values against `isUnique` — its census
names no value-level constraint and its evaluator answers `1, 1, 2` for
`OrderedSet { :>> elements = (1, 1, 2); }` — which is why the contradiction never surfaces there.

OpenSysML enforces `isUnique` on values (KerML §8.4.3.4 item 6, "if a Feature is unique, there
are no values with the same markings"), so it has to pick a reading under which the library's
own declarations and defaults are conforming:

- A **fresh or subsetting** multi-valued feature is unique unless declared `nonunique`
  (§7.3.4.4 as written).
- A **redefinition** stating neither keyword takes the uniqueness of the features it redefines,
  all of them (§7.3.4.5: the redefining feature's values are the redefined feature's values, so a
  restriction the redefined feature does not impose is not imposed by restating it — the same way
  type, multiplicity and ordering already reach a redefinition here). `3dVectorQuantityValue::num`
  and `CartesianSpatial3dCoordinateFrame::mRefs` are then nonunique, as their defaults require.
- The **four `Collections` redefinitions above** are read as unique, as their notes say, against
  what the inheritance reading would give them. This is the erratum: the library states its
  intent in a comment where the notation has a keyword for it, and the keyword — restating
  nothing — points the other way. `Set`, `OrderedSet`, `Map`, `OrderedMap`, and a model's
  `:>> elements` under any of them, inherit uniqueness from these four.

Implementation: `internal/semantic/semantics/uniqueness.go` (`Model.IsUnique`, `uniqueByLibraryNote`).
Evidence: `semantics/uniqueness_test.go:TestIsUniqueLibraryCollections` pins all six library
collections; the conformance fixtures under `internal/exec/runtime/testdata/conformance/`
for ISQ vectors, coordinate frames and geometry run unchanged, and
`library_ordered_set_elements_repeated` / `library_ordered_map_elements_repeated` refuse the repeat.
The row is in [spec-compliance.md](spec-compliance.md) under *Uniqueness through redefinition
and subsetting*. Recorded for review against a future KerML release: either the four
redefinitions should say `unique` in notation the grammar does not yet have, or `§7.3.4.4`
should say which of the two readings a redefinition takes.

## `includingAt` — the vendored declaration

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Kernel Libraries/Kernel Function Library/SequenceFunctions.kerml`:

```kerml
function includingAt{ in seq: Anything[0..*] ordered nonunique; in values: Anything[0..*] ordered nonunique;
    in index: Positive[1];
    return : Anything[0..*] ordered nonunique =
        (seq->subsequence(1, index - 1), values, seq->subsequence(index + 1));
}
```

`subsequence(1, index - 1)` is the prefix ending before `index`, and
`subsequence(index + 1)` is the tail starting after `index`; the element at
`index` appears in neither, so evaluating the body as written *replaces* it with
`values` rather than inserting before it. OpenSysML implements insertion
(maintainer ruling), so `includingAt` is a divergence from the
vendored body and is recorded here for review against a future OMG release.

## `NaturalFunctions::'/'` — the declared Natural return against the pilot's Rational answer

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Kernel Libraries/Kernel Function Library/NaturalFunctions.kerml`:

```kerml
function '/' specializes IntegerFunctions::'/' { in x: Natural[1]; in y: Natural[1]; return : Natural[1]; }
```

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** `NaturalFunctions::'/'` declares
`return : Natural[1]`, but the pinned pilot implementation (`2026-05`,
`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.60.1) evaluates `5 / 2` to `LiteralRational 2.5` even
when both operands are `Natural`-typed attributes
(`attribute a : ScalarValues::Natural = 5; attribute b : ScalarValues::Natural = 2;`).
Its evaluator dispatches on the value's kind rather than the declared type, so
the division runs through `RationalFunctions::'/'` — the function
`IntegerFunctions::'/'` specializes with `return : Rational[1]` — and no
truncating Natural division is observable. A `Natural[1]` return would require
the quotient to be truncated or the call to be rejected, and the pilot does
neither. Is the declared return type intended to be `Rational[1]` (matching
`IntegerFunctions::'/'`), or is a conforming evaluator expected to truncate?
````

OpenSysML follows the pilot's observed behavior for the operator: the type
checker (`passes/typecheck_expr.go` `divisionResult`) types `Natural/Natural`
division as `Rational`, and the runtime answers a Real, so a non-whole quotient
bound to a `Natural`-typed feature is reported rather than truncated. The
function called by name, `NaturalFunctions::'/'(x, y)`, is the one place the
declaration itself is the contract: it returns the Natural quotient when `y`
divides `x` and reports a non-whole quotient (`ErrArithmeticDomain`) rather
than truncating or answering a Rational (`runtime/library_operators.go`
`naturalDivision`).

## `VectorCalculations::inner`/`norm` — a `Number` where the scalar calculations return a quantity

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/VectorCalculations.sysml`:

```sysml
	calc def inner :> VectorFunctions::inner { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : Number[1]; }
	calc def norm :> VectorFunctions::norm { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : Number[1]; }
	calc def angle :> VectorFunctions::angle { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : Number[1]; }
```

and from `QuantityCalculations.sysml` in the same directory:

```sysml
	calc def '*' specializes NumericalFunctions::'*' { in x: ScalarQuantityValue[1]; in y: ScalarQuantityValue[1]; return : ScalarQuantityValue[1]; }
	calc def '/' specializes NumericalFunctions::'/' { in x: ScalarQuantityValue[1]; in y: ScalarQuantityValue[1]; return : ScalarQuantityValue[1]; }
	calc def sqrt{ in x: ScalarQuantityValue[1]; return : ScalarQuantityValue[1]; }
```

````markdown
**Library inconsistency, question rather than bug report:** the scalar
quantity calculations keep the quantity through an operation —
`QuantityCalculations::'*'`, `'/'` and `sqrt` all declare
`return : ScalarQuantityValue[1]`, so `sqrt(q * q)` of a length `q` is a
length — but the vector quantity calculations drop it: `VectorCalculations::inner`
and `norm` declare `return : Number[1]` over `VectorQuantityValue` operands.
The norm of a length vector is therefore a bare number, and the inner product of
two length vectors a bare number too, although each is a quantity of the operands'
unit (or its square) in the same way `q * q` is. Only `angle` is naturally
dimensionless. Is `Number[1]` the intended return for `inner` and `norm`, with
the unit understood to be implied by the operands, or should they return
`ScalarQuantityValue[1]` as the scalar calculations do? (A redefinition of
`VectorFunctions::inner`/`norm`, whose returns are `Number`, could not narrow
to `ScalarQuantityValue` since that is not a `Number`; a resolution would need
the vector calculations declared independently of `VectorFunctions`, as
`QuantityCalculations::'*'` is of `NumericalFunctions::'*'` only by
specialization.)
````

The pinned pilot implementation (`2026-07`, `jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0)
evaluates none of these: asked through `build/pilot-evaluator/eval-sysml` for
`VectorFunctions::norm(CartesianVectorOf((3.0, 4.0)))`,
`VectorCalculations::norm(...)`, a `Number` attribute bound to the former,
`QuantityCalculations::sqrt(q * q)` and `q * q` over `q : ScalarQuantityValue = 2 [m]`,
it answers the unevaluated `InvocationExpression norm`, `InvocationExpression sqrt`
and `OperatorExpression *` for every case, so it offers no reference for either
reading.

OpenSysML follows the declarations: the checker types `inner`, `norm` and `angle`
of vector quantities as `Number` (a `ScalarQuantityValue` feature bound to one is a
static error, a `Number` feature is accepted), and the runtime answers the bare
number computed over the vector's `num` components — `norm(⟨3.0, 4.0⟩ [m])` is
`5.0`, `inner(⟨1.0, 2.0⟩ [m], ⟨3.0, 4.0⟩ [m])` is `11.0` — the unit dropped by
declaration (`runtime/vector_functions.go`; conformance
`calc_library_vector_quantity_norm`). The scalar calculations keep their quantity
results as declared (`runtime/quantity_functions.go`).

## `VectorCalculations::outer` — a `VectorQuantityValue` return for an order-two product

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/VectorCalculations.sysml`:

```sysml
    calc def outer { in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; in : VectorQuantityValue[1]; return : VectorQuantityValue[1]; }
```

and from `TensorCalculations.sysml` in the same directory:

```sysml
    calc def '[' specializes BaseFunctions::'[' { 
    	in elements: Number[1..n] ordered nonunique; 
    	in mRef: TensorMeasurementReference[1]; 
    	return quantity: TensorQuantityValue[1];
    	private attribute n = mRef.flattenedSize;
    }
```

````markdown
**Library defect:** `VectorCalculations::outer` declares
`return : VectorQuantityValue[1]`. The outer product of two vectors of orders
one is a tensor of order two — `dimensions` of two entries, `order` two — and
`Quantities::VectorQuantityValue` is the subtype of `TensorQuantityValue` whose
`dimensions` has at most one entry (`VectorMeasurementReference::dimensions :
Positive[0..1]`), so no value of the declared type can hold the result. The
sibling `TensorCalculations::'['` returns `TensorQuantityValue[1]` for exactly
this shape, and `TensorCalculations::tensorVectorMult`/`vectorTensorMult`
return `VectorQuantityValue` where the contraction does lower the order.
Should `outer` declare `return : TensorQuantityValue[1]`?
````

The pinned pilot implementation (`2026-07`, `jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0)
evaluates no `VectorCalculations` or `TensorCalculations` call
(`tools/referee/exec`, `tensor_quantities.cases`: all twelve probes, `outer` among
them, are pinned `pilot-unevaluated`), so it
offers no reference answer. OpenSysML leaves `outer` unevaluable with a reason
naming the declared return type (`runtime/quantity_functions.go`
`registerVectorCalculations`; robustness `tensor_quantity_failure_modes`), and
types a call by the declaration, as the checker must.

## `TensorCalculations::isUnitTensorQuantity` — the reading OpenSysML takes

Not a defect report; a record of a reading the text does not fix.

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/TensorCalculations.sysml`:

```sysml
    calc def isZeroTensorQuantity { 
    	in x : TensorQuantityValue[1]; 
    	return : Boolean[1];
    }
    calc def isUnitTensorQuantity { 
    	in x : TensorQuantityValue[1]; 
    	return : Boolean[1];
    }
```

`isZeroTensorQuantity` has one reading — every component zero — and OpenSysML
answers it for a tensor of any shape. `isUnitTensorQuantity` has a body neither
here nor in a Kernel function it specializes, and `VectorCalculations::isUnitVectorQuantity`
(a vector of norm one) does not generalize: a tensor has no single norm the
library names. The one tensor with an established claim to the name is the
identity matrix, which exists for a square tensor of order two alone (the
library's own matrix, `AffineTransformationMatrix3d`, is an order-two `Array`).
OpenSysML therefore answers
`isUnitTensorQuantity` for a square order-two tensor (`true` exactly when the
diagonal is one and the rest zero) and reports any other shape as
`ErrUnevaluableLibraryFunction` naming the shape it needs
(`runtime/tensor_functions.go` `tensorIsUnit`; conformance
`instance_tensor_quantity`, `instance_tensor_quantity_failures`). Nothing is
invented for a vector, a rectangular or a higher-order tensor.

## `CoordinateFramePlacement`, `Rotation`, `VectorCalculations::transform` — the direction of a transformation, the magnitude of a direction, and the axes of an intrinsic rotation

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/MeasurementReferences.sysml`:

```sysml
	attribute def CoordinateFramePlacement :> CoordinateTransformation {
    	doc
    	/*
    	 * CoordinateFramePlacement is a CoordinateTransformation by placement of the target frame in the source frame.
    	 *
    	 * Attribute origin specifies the location of the origin of the target frame as a vector in the source frame.
    	 *
    	 * Attribute basisDirections specifies the orientation of the target frame by specifying the directions of
    	 * the respective basis vectors of the target frame via direction vectors in the source frame. An empty sequence of
    	 * basisDirections signifies no change of orientation of the target coordinate frame.
    	 */
		attribute origin : VectorQuantityValue[1];
		attribute basisDirections : VectorQuantityValue[0..*] ordered nonunique;
```

```sysml
	attribute def Rotation :> TranslationOrRotation {
		/*
		 * Attribute isIntrinsic asserts whether the intermediate coordinate frame moves with the rotation or not,
		 * i.e. whether an instrinsic or extrinsic rotation is specified.
		 *
		 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport_chained_rotations for details.
		 */
		attribute axisDirection : VectorQuantityValue[1];
		attribute angle :>> angularMeasure;
		attribute isIntrinsic : Boolean[1] default true;
	}
```

and from `VectorCalculations.sysml` in the same directory:

```sysml
	calc def transform {
	    in transformation : CoordinateTransformation;
	    in sourceVector : VectorQuantityValue { :>> mRef = transformation.source; }
	    return targetVector : VectorQuantityValue { :>> mRef = transformation.target { ... } }
	}
```

````markdown
**Clarification request:** `VectorCalculations::transform` re-expresses a vector
quantity written over `transformation.source` as one over `transformation.target`,
and `CoordinateFramePlacement` describes the target frame from within the source
(`origin` is "the location of the origin of the target frame as a vector in the
source frame"; `basisDirections` are "the directions of the respective basis
vectors of the target frame via direction vectors in the source frame"). Three
things the text leaves to the reader decide the numbers `transform` answers:

1. **Direction.** Read literally, a placement maps *target* coordinates into
   *source* coordinates: a point at target coordinates `t` sits at
   `origin + B t` in the source, `B` the matrix whose columns are the basis
   directions. `transform(source → target)` must then apply the **inverse**,
   `B⁻¹ (v − origin)`, and a `Translation` in a `TranslationRotationSequence`
   *subtracts* its `translationVector` from the source coordinates. Is that the
   intent, or does a placement state the mapping `transform` applies directly
   (`v_target = origin + B v_source`)? The two readings agree only for the
   `NullTransformation`.
2. **Magnitude of a direction.** `basisDirections` are "direction vectors", which
   suggests only their direction is meaningful and `B` is built from the
   normalized vectors; but a `VectorQuantityValue` carries a magnitude, and
   `(0, 2, 0)[datum]` as a basis direction could equally state a target axis of
   twice the source unit. Should a non-unit direction be normalized, scale the
   axis, or be a violation?
3. **Intrinsic rotations.** For a `Rotation` with `isIntrinsic = true` (the
   default), the Davenport reference the doc cites turns about the axis of the
   *intermediate* frame, i.e. `axisDirection` as the earlier elements of the
   sequence have moved it, and an extrinsic one about `axisDirection` fixed in
   the source; the composition order of the two therefore differs. Is
   `axisDirection` written in the source frame in both cases, and does a
   `Translation` between two rotations move the intermediate frame's origin
   without affecting the axes?

A fourth, smaller point: `MeasurementScale`s that specialize `CoordinateFrame`
(`IntervalScale`) state `basisDirections` in one dimension (`1 [UTC]` in the
validation suite's `MissionElapsedTimeScale`). A magnitude of 1 is the identity;
is a magnitude other than 1 a scale factor between the two scales' units, or is
the unit's own `unitConversion` the only factor a scale may apply?
````

The pinned pilot implementation (`2026-07`, `jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0)
evaluates none of `transform`, `MeasurementRefCalculations::'CoordinateFrame/'`,
`VectorCalculations::'['` over a frame or `ConvertQuantity` to a scale
(`tools/referee/exec/testdata/cases/coordinate_frames.cases` pins the probes as
pilot-unevaluated), so it offers no reference answer for any of the four.

OpenSysML follows the literal reading of each: a placement maps target
coordinates into the source and `transform` applies the inverse (a
`TranslationRotationSequence` of a translation and a rotation followed by its
inverse sequence round-trips, conformance `instance_coordinate_frames`); basis
directions are normalized, a zero or a linearly dependent direction being a typed
error; an intrinsic rotation turns about the axis as the earlier elements moved
it and an extrinsic one about the axis fixed in the source; and a one-dimensional
basis direction of magnitude 1 is the identity while any other magnitude is a
typed error naming it, the library giving a scale no other basis
(`runtime/frame_transform.go`, `runtime/scale_conversion.go`; the compliance
record's *Structured values* section names each decision).

## `ShapeItems::CuboidOrTriangularPrism` — edge and vertex groups fixed only by `[0..1]` bindings, and a vertex count its faces exceed

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Quoted verbatim from
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib/Domain Libraries/Geometry/ShapeItems.sysml`
(`CuboidOrTriangularPrism`; `Cuboid` adds the `srf`, `tsre`, `ufre`, `urre`,
`tfrv`, `trrv` bindings in the same form):

```sysml

**Library question, two parts.**

**1. The edge and vertex groups are underdetermined.** `tfe [2] :> edges` (the two
edge portions where the top and front faces meet) is valued by nothing but
`binding [1] bind [0..1] tf.edges = [0..1] tfe` and
`binding [1] bind [0..1] ff.edges = [0..1] tfe`. The `[0..1]` on each end is a
connector-end multiplicity (KerML 1.0 §7.4.6.2): each binding declares exactly one
`SelfLink` (§8.4.4.6.2 BindingConnector) joining *some* value of `tf.edges` to *some*
value of `tfe`, and constrains how many values of either end take part — it does not say
which of `tf`'s four edges is meant. Nothing else in the model does either:
`tf.edges` and `ff.edges` are disjoint objects, so their bindings pick two different
members of `tfe` without relating them to each other; the other bindings on `tf.edges`
(`tre`, `tsle`, and `tsre` in `Cuboid`) each pick one unspecified edge too, and no
constraint says the four groups partition `tf.edges`; `connection :MatesWith connect
[1] tfe to [1] tfe` relates the two members of the group to one another, which every
choice satisfies alike; and `size(edges) == 24` counts `faces.edges`, which the groups
do not affect. The three `[0..1] tfe.vertices` / `tsle.vertices` / `ufle.vertices`
bindings on `tflv [3]` repeat the pattern one level down, over the four vertices of
each group's two edges. So any two edges of `tf` are as good a `tfe` as any other —
the model determines the groups' sizes, not their members — and an evaluator asked
for `tfe`, `tflv`, `tfe.length` or `vertices` (subsetted by the groups) has nothing
to answer with but a guess. Are the bindings intended as an identification of a
*particular* edge (e.g. `tf.e1` and `ff.e3`), spelled by position as `Quadrilateral`
spells `edges [4] = (e1, e2, e3, e4)`? If so the groups need a value, or the bindings
need to name the members (`bind tf.e1 = tfe#(1)`).

**2. `size(vertices) == size(edges)` is unsatisfiable for a `Cuboid`.** `vertices`
is inherited from `StructuredSpaceObject`, whose `faces.vertices subsets vertices`,
and each `Quadrilateral` face declares `vertices [8]` (two per edge, the endpoints of
consecutive edges being distinct mating occurrences). A `Cuboid` therefore holds at
least 6 × 8 = 48 vertex objects, while `edges = faces.edges` holds 6 × 4 = 24 and the
assertion requires 24 vertices. The eight corner groups `tflv [3]` … `brrv [3]` sum
to exactly 24, so the assertion appears to count those and to intend `vertices` to
be the corner groups alone — which the inherited subsetting forbids. Should the
assertion read over the groups (or over the distinct meeting points), or should
`vertices` be redefined to exclude the faces' own vertices?

(Aside: the face redefinitions in `CuboidOrTriangularPrism`, `TriangularPrism` and
`Cuboid` read `ref :>> Quadrilateral::edges, ConeOrCylinder::faces::edges;` — they
name `ConeOrCylinder`'s faces from a `Polyhedron` that is not one. `faces::edges`
resolves the same feature, as the `ff`/`rf` declarations beside them spell it.)
````

The pinned pilot implementation (`2026-07`) offers no reference here: asked through
`build/pilot-evaluator/eval-sysml` for `box.tfe`, `box.tflv`, `box.vertices` and
`box.edges` over `part box : ShapeItems::Box { :>> length = 2 [m]; :>> width = 1 [m];
:>> height = 3 [m]; }`, it answers the unevaluated `ItemUsage tfe`, `ItemUsage tflv`,
`ItemUsage vertices` and `ItemUsage edges`, and `box.tfe.length` is
`Couldn't resolve reference to Feature 'length'`. Neither validator reports the pattern:
the specification places no conformance rule between a connector end's multiplicity and
the multiplicity of the feature it relates (`[0..1]` ends over `[2]` and `[4]` features
are well-formed): OpenSysML's `-validate` accepts the `Box` model clean, and the pilot
loads the library and the model without complaint before leaving the usages unevaluated.

OpenSysML answers `box.faces` (6), `box.edges` (24), `box.tf.edges` (4) and every
face-local value; the groups and everything read through them are the typed
`ErrBindingEnd` naming the binding and both ends, on `-e`, `%eval`, `-instantiate`
and `%features` alike (`runtime/binding.go` `UndeterminedBindingError`; conformance
`instance_library_geometry_box`):

```text
binding end cannot be resolved: box.tfe is bound by `binding [1] bind [0..1] tf.edges = [0..1] tfe`, which makes some value of tfe a value of tf.edges without saying which value of either; the model does not state what tfe holds
```

The runtime reads each partial binding on its own and does not solve the conjunction of several, so a group two partial bindings *would*
pin down — two collections sharing exactly one value, bound `[0..1]` to a `[1]`
feature — is reported the same way; that is a limitation recorded in
[spec-compliance.md](spec-compliance.md), not a reading of this library, whose groups
no conjunction pins down.

## Defects in published OMG example models

These rows are true positives found by OpenSysML's static analysis in models published with the
OMG example corpora. The pinned pilot is silent on each because it does not perform the
corresponding check.

| Example | Expression as published | Defect | Specification reading | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Geometry Examples/VehicleGeometryAndCoordinateFrames.sysml:38` | `22/2*25.4 + 110 [mm]` | `[mm]` binds only to `110`, so `+` combines a dimensionless value with a length | KerML 1.0 §8.2.5.8.1–8.2.5.8.2 makes the bracket construction a primary expression; SysML v2.0 §9.8.9.1 requires addition operands to have the same quantity dimension. The evident intended spelling is `(22/2*25.4 + 110) [mm]`. | **not filed** |
| `Analysis Examples/Turbojet Stage Analysis.sysml:25` | `1/(2 * Cp) * V^2 + T_static`, with `Cp : DimensionOneValue`, `V : VolumeValue`, and `T_static : TemperatureValue` | the declared types make the operands L^6 and Θ | SysML v2.0 §9.8.9.1 requires addition operands to have the same quantity dimension and top-level quantity type. The formula needs dimensionally appropriate parameter declarations or conversion before addition. | **not filed** |
| `Analysis Examples/Dynamics.sysml:13` | `return a : AccelerationValue = tp * dt * tp;`, with `tp : PowerValue` and `dt : TimeValue` | a power squared times a duration has dimension L^4·M^2·T^-5, not the L·T^-2 an `AccelerationValue` is measured in | KerML 7.4.9 makes the expression the return feature's value, so it answers to that feature's type, and the ISQ definitions the file imports fix the dimensions: `AccelerationUnit` is L^1·T^-2, `PowerUnit` is L^2·M^1·T^-3, and `TimeValue` aliases `DurationValue` (T^1). No grouping of the published product is an acceleration. | **not filed** |
| `Individuals Examples/AnalysisIndividualExample.sysml:86` | `individual action :>> fuelConsumption : FuelEconomyAnalysis_1` | the redefining action is typed by the enclosing analysis definition, which does not conform to the redefined feature's `FuelConsumption` | KerML 7.4.9 and 8.3.4.2 make a redefinition a subsetting, so the redefining feature's type must conform to the redefined one's. The file declares `individual action def FuelConsumption_1 :> FuelConsumption` and never uses it: that is the intended type. | **fixed upstream at `2026-07`** — the corpus now publishes `fuelConsumption : FuelConsumption_1`, the type this row named, so the row is closed and its overlay entry retired |

The first two rows form one adjudicated quantity-commensurability family in
[the adjudications record](adjudications.md); the third is the same physics read through a
declared type rather than through an addition, so it is an error and not a warning; and the fourth
was the corpus instance of the subsetting-conformance divergence adjudicated in
[the same record](adjudications.md), which the `2026-07` corpus corrects on its own.
OpenSysML retains the three open diagnostics, and nothing has been posted upstream. All three are
entries of the declared errata overlay — the geometry row with a correction, the turbojet and
dynamics rows without one — quoted verbatim with their derivations in
[the fourth section](#the-errata-overlay-entries-for-these-models).

## Defects in the vendored quantity libraries

These are the findings the expression type checker reports in the standard library as OMG
published it: each is a unit declaration in `SI.sysml` or `USCustomaryUnits.sysml` whose value
does not have the dimension of the measurement unit it is typed by, judged against the `ISQ`
definitions those files import. The pinned pilot is silent on every one, as on the example rows
above, because it does not perform the corresponding check.

Every finding is an entry of the declared errata overlay (`tools/oracle/errata`,
[the declared errata overlay](errata-overlay.md)), under the same contract as the example-model
entries below: a specification citation, a written derivation, and an as-published line that
must still match the vendored file, all checked by tests. The published bytes under
`internal/workspace/libs/stdlib` are never edited. Three entries carry a correction — the line has
one reading with the declared dimension — and the library a process loads
(`libs.BundledSource`, and the snapshot generated from it) is the published text with those
three lines substituted on read. The other six have no unambiguous intended reading and are
documented **without** a correction: the bundled library keeps their published text and the
checker keeps reporting them. `libs.EmbeddedSource` still serves the text exactly as published,
and two gates in `internal/workspace/model` pin both verdicts as exact sets:
`TestExprTypeCheckPublishedStdlibDefects` finds all nine over the published text, and
`TestExprTypeCheckNoStdlibFalsePositives` finds exactly the six uncorrected ones over the bundled
library — so a correction can only be declared for a line the checker rejects, and a corrected
line that still reports fails the gate.

The DRYAS import-clash rule exposes another issue: `ISQ` re-exports distinct
`MagneticDipoleMomentUnit` definitions from `ISQAtomicNuclear` and
`ISQElectromagnetism`. The original SI text has unresolved references to that name
at lines 233 and 303. `TestStdlibMagneticDipoleMomentNameClash` checks those original
references. The dimensional tests below qualify the target as
`ISQElectromagnetism::MagneticDipoleMomentUnit` in memory, retaining every existing
dimensional assertion. This is an explicit comparison control, not a claim about
which target the library author intended; the vendored library is unchanged.

| Library file | Declared type | Dimension of the value | Dimension of the type | Overlay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Domain Libraries/Quantities and Units/SI.sysml:137` | `ISQAtomicNuclear::TotalMassStoppingPowerUnit` | T^-2 | L^4·T^-2 | corrected |

Nothing here has been posted upstream; filing is the user's decision. The Quantities and Units
domain library is normative content of the SysML v2 specification, so the channel for a fix is an
OMG issue against the specification, with an issue on `Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release` (which
ships the library) as the informal route to the pilot maintainers.

### `'eV⋅m⁻²/kg' : TotalMassStoppingPowerUnit = eV*m^-2/kg` is T^-2

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:137:

```sysml
attribute <'eV⋅m⁻²/kg'> 'electronvolt metre to the power minus 2 per kilogram' : TotalMassStoppingPowerUnit = eV*m^-2/kg;
```

Corrected by the overlay:

```sysml
attribute <'eV⋅m⁻²/kg'> 'electronvolt metre to the power minus 2 per kilogram' : TotalMassStoppingPowerUnit = eV*m^2/kg;
```

ISO 80000-10 item 10-55 defines mass stopping power as energy × area per mass, L^4·T^-2, which
is the dimension `TotalMassStoppingPowerUnit` declares through its `quantityDimension` and the
dimension of the file's own `J*m^2/kg` at line 147. `eV*m^-2/kg` is T^-2, and `eV*m^2/kg` is the
only reading of an electronvolt spelling with the declared dimension, so **KerML 7.4.9** (a
feature's value conforms to its type) is satisfied by exactly one repair. The short name and the
long name stay as published, so the element's normative identity — derived from its qualified
name — is unchanged; only the symbol `eV⋅m⁻²/kg` still spells the published exponent.

### `'J⋅s⋅eV⋅s' : TotalAngularMomentumUnit = J*s*eV*s` squares an angular momentum

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:149:

```sysml
attribute <'J⋅s⋅eV⋅s'> 'joule second electronvolt second' : TotalAngularMomentumUnit = J*s*eV*s;
```

`J*s` and `eV*s` are each an angular momentum (L^2·M·T^-1, ISO 80000-10 item 10-11), and their
product is L^4·M^2·T^-2, which **KerML 7.4.9** rejects against the declared unit. The two are
different units (a joule second and an electronvolt second), and the names spell both, so which
the line means cannot be inferred: this row is **documented without a correction**, and the
checker keeps reporting it over the bundled library.

### `'J⁻¹⋅m⁻³⋅eV⁻¹⋅m⁻³' : EnergyDensityOfStatesUnit = J^-1*m^-3*eV^-1*m^-3` squares a density of states

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:163:

```sysml
attribute <'J⁻¹⋅m⁻³⋅eV⁻¹⋅m⁻³'> 'joule to the power minus 1 metre to the power minus 3 electronvolt to the power minus 1 metre to the power minus 3' : EnergyDensityOfStatesUnit = J^-1*m^-3*eV^-1*m^-3;
```

`J^-1*m^-3` and `eV^-1*m^-3` are each an energy density of states (L^-5·M^-1·T^2, ISO 80000-12
item 12-16), and their product is L^-10·M^-2·T^4 (**KerML 7.4.9**). As at line 149 the two are
different units and the names spell both, so this row is **documented without a correction**.

### `'m²⋅A' : MagneticDipoleMomentUnit = m^2*A` names the electromagnetic unit for the atomic one

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:233:

```sysml
attribute <'m²⋅A'> 'metre squared ampere' : MagneticDipoleMomentUnit = m^2*A;
```

`ISQ::*` re-exports two `MagneticDipoleMomentUnit`s under one name: the electromagnetic one
(L^3·M·T^-2·I^-1, IEC 80000-6 item 6-30, unit `Wb⋅m`, in `ISQElectromagnetism`) and the atomic
one (L^2·I, ISO 80000-10 item 10-9.1, unit `m²⋅A`, in `ISQAtomicNuclear`). `m^2*A` is the atomic
unit; the unqualified name in `SI` resolves to the electromagnetic one, and the value fails
**KerML 7.4.9** against it. Qualifying the type on this line would fix the symptom, but the name
clash lives in the `ISQ` library and every unqualified use of either name shares it, so this row
is **documented without a correction** pending an upstream decision on the two definitions.

### `'m²⋅s⁻³' : DoseEquivalentUnit = m^2*s^-3` types a dose-equivalent rate as a dose equivalent

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:239:

```sysml
attribute <'m²⋅s⁻³'> 'metre squared second to the power minus 3' : DoseEquivalentUnit = m^2*s^-3;
```

`m^2*s^-3` is L^2·T^-3, a dose-equivalent *rate*: ISO 80000-10 item 10-83.2, whose units the
`ISQAtomicNuclear` documentation lists as `Sv/s, W/kg, m^2*s^-3`. `DoseEquivalentUnit` is
L^2·T^-2 (**KerML 7.4.9**). `ISQAtomicNuclear` declares `doseEquivalentRate: DoseEquivalentValue`
rather than a rate value type with a unit of its own, so there is no unit in the library to
retype this line by, and inventing one is a library design decision; this row and the two below
are **documented without a correction**.

### `'m³/C⋅m³⋅s⁻¹⋅A⁻¹' : HallCoefficientUnit = m^3/C*m^3*s^-1*A^-1` squares a Hall coefficient

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:247:

```sysml
attribute <'m³/C⋅m³⋅s⁻¹⋅A⁻¹'> 'metre cubed per coulomb cubic metre second to the power minus 1 ampere to the power minus 1' : HallCoefficientUnit = m^3/C*m^3*s^-1*A^-1;
```

Corrected by the overlay:

```sysml
attribute <'m³/C⋅m³⋅s⁻¹⋅A⁻¹'> 'metre cubed per coulomb cubic metre second to the power minus 1 ampere to the power minus 1' : HallCoefficientUnit = m^3/C;
```

`m^3/C` and `m^3*s^-1*A^-1` are one coherent unit spelled twice — `C` is declared `A*s` in the
same file — each the Hall coefficient of ISO 80000-12 item 12-19 (L^3·T^-1·I^-1) that
`HallCoefficientUnit` declares; their product is L^6·T^-2·I^-2 (**KerML 7.4.9**). Unlike lines
149 and 163, either spelling alone denotes the same unit, so the correction chooses nothing: the
first spelling is substituted and the names stay as published, keeping the element's identity.

### `'Sv/s' : DoseEquivalentUnit = Sv/s` types a dose-equivalent rate as a dose equivalent

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:286:

```sysml
attribute <'Sv/s'> 'sievert per second' : DoseEquivalentUnit = Sv/s;
```

`Sv/s` is L^2·T^-3, a dose-equivalent rate (ISO 80000-10 item 10-83.2), while
`DoseEquivalentUnit` is L^2·T^-2 (**KerML 7.4.9**); as at line 239 no rate unit exists to retype
the line by, so this row is **documented without a correction**.

### `'W/kg' : DoseEquivalentUnit = W/kg` types a dose-equivalent rate as a dose equivalent

**Not filed.** Published, `SI.sysml`:299:

```sysml
attribute <'W/kg'> 'watt per kilogram' : DoseEquivalentUnit = W/kg;
```

`W/kg` is L^2·T^-3, a dose-equivalent rate (ISO 80000-10 item 10-83.2), while
`DoseEquivalentUnit` is L^2·T^-2 (**KerML 7.4.9**); as at line 239 no rate unit exists to retype
the line by, so this row is **documented without a correction**.

### `zeroDegreeFahrenheitInKelvin = 229835/900 [K]` divides by a temperature

**Not filed.** Published, `USCustomaryUnits.sysml`:255:

```sysml
private attribute zeroDegreeFahrenheitInKelvin: ThermodynamicTemperatureValue = 229835/900 [K];
```

Corrected by the overlay:

```sysml
private attribute zeroDegreeFahrenheitInKelvin: ThermodynamicTemperatureValue = (229835/900) [K];
```

`'[' SequenceExpression ']'` is a postfix on `PrimaryExpression`
(`build/pilot-grammars/KerMLExpressions.xtext:308`), below `MultiplicativeExpression`, so `[K]`
qualifies `900` alone and the value is `229835 / (900 [K])`, of dimension Θ^-1, where
`ThermodynamicTemperatureValue` is Θ. **SysML v2 §9.8.9.1** makes the published expression
unsatisfiable under any reading — the same defect as the geometry example's
`22/2*25.4 + 110 [mm]` — and the evident intent, 0 °F as a temperature in kelvin
(255.372… K), is the parenthesised form.

## Defects in the pilot implementation

The first section records a defect in a vendored library body, and the second records defects in
published example models. This section records defects in the **OMG SysML v2 pilot implementation**
(`Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation`), which
[pilot-differential.md](pilot-differential.md) uses as the reference oracle. A
row lands here only when it is established from the pilot's own artifacts — its
grammar, its `.ecore`, or its loaded object graph probed through its own API —
and not from a disagreement alone.

### `Type::ownedDisjoining` does not contain a `Disjoining` whose `owningType` is that `Type` (pilot `2026-05`)

Filed as
[Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation#790](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation/issues/790);
the body below is what was submitted, and the supporting analysis is
[the disjoining diagnostics, one by one](pilot-differential.md#k6-diagnostic-by-diagnostic-f33).
Closed upstream by
[#791](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation/pull/791), which
confirmed the cause named below — `Type_ownedDisjoining_SettingDelegate.basicGet` filtered on
`getTypeDisjoined() == this`, the delegate, rather than the owning type, so `ownedDisjoining` was
always empty — and the `2026-08` release carries the fix: the six differential rows are gone and
the three-line reproducer validates clean.

````markdown
### Every `disjoint from` clause in a type declaration reports an unpaired bidirectional reference

**Version:** `2026-05` (validated through `jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.60.1, the KerML
standalone setup + `SysMLUtil`).

#### Minimal reproduction

`Decl.kerml`, complete — no imports, no library references:

```kerml
package Decl {
    classifier A;
    classifier B disjoint from A;
}
```

Validate it on its own, in a fresh resource set.

#### Expected

No diagnostics. `disjoint from` in a type declaration is
`DisjoiningPart` (`org.omg.sysml.xtext/src/org/omg/sysml/xtext/KerML.xtext:344`,
reached from `TypeRelationshipPart` at `:340`), and this is how the shipped
example models write it — six of the `.kerml` files under
`org.omg.sysml.examples`/`kerml-examples` use exactly this clause
(`Simple Tests/Types.kerml:31`, `Simple Tests/Classifiers.kerml:13`,
`Simple Tests/Features.kerml:20`, `Simple Tests/Inverses.kerml:3`,
`Simple Tests/FeatureChains.kerml:31`,
`KerML Spec Annex A Examples/A-2-ModelingInstances.kerml:9`).

#### Actual

One error per clause, on the clause's line:

```
The opposite features 'owningType' of 'org.omg.sysml.lang.sysml.impl.DisjoiningImpl{Simple Tests/Types.kerml#//@ownedRelationship.0/@ownedRelatedElement.0/@ownedRelationship.14/@ownedRelatedElement.0/@ownedRelationship.1}' and 'ownedDisjoining' of 'org.omg.sysml.lang.sysml.impl.TypeImpl{Simple Tests/Types.kerml#//@ownedRelationship.0/@ownedRelatedElement.0/@ownedRelationship.14/@ownedRelatedElement.0}' do not refer to each other
```

This is EMF's `_UI_UnpairedBidirectionalReference_diagnostic`, raised by
`EObjectValidator` over an `EReference` pair — not a `KerMLValidator` rule — so
it is a statement about the loaded object graph rather than about the model.
All six example files above report it; the parse itself succeeds, and the
standalone form `disjoint b.f.a from b.a;`
(`Simple Tests/FeatureChains.kerml:28`) does not report it. It is not a batching
artifact: each file reproduces the diagnostic when validated alone in a fresh
resource set.

#### Mechanism

`Disjoining::owningType` declares `eOpposite="#//Type/ownedDisjoining"` in
`org.omg.sysml/model/SysML.ecore`, and `Type::ownedDisjoining` is derived,
transient and volatile — its setting delegate selects the `Type`'s
`ownedRelationship`s that are `Disjoining`s whose `typeDisjoined` is that
`Type`. Probing the reproducer's loaded model through the pilot's own API gives:

```
Disjoining //@ownedRelationship.0/@ownedRelatedElement.0/@ownedRelationship.1/@ownedRelatedElement.0/@ownedRelationship.0
  owner                = ClassifierImpl(B)
  owningRelatedElement = ClassifierImpl(B)
  typeDisjoined        = ClassifierImpl(B)
  disjoiningType       = ClassifierImpl(A)
  owningType           = ClassifierImpl(B)
  owner.ownedDisjoining        = []
  owner.ownedRelationship size= 1
    rel DisjoiningImpl same=true
```

`B.ownedRelationship` contains the `Disjoining`, that `Disjoining`'s
`typeDisjoined` and `owningType` are both `B` — and yet the derived
`B.ownedDisjoining`, the other end of the `eOpposite` pair, is empty. So the
delegate does not return a `Disjoining` that satisfies its own documented
derivation, and EMF's check on the pair then fails for every `disjoint from`
clause written in a type declaration.

`OwnedDisjoining` (`KerML.xtext:437`) sets only `disjoiningType`; the owned form
leaves `typeDisjoined` to be the owning type, which the standalone `Disjoining`
production (`:426`) instead names explicitly — consistent with the standalone
form being unaffected.
````

#### Does a fix upstream clear the whole `kerml-examples` column?

Yes, and it was checked file by file rather than by family, since the answer
decides whether this root's pilot-only rows are ours to act on at all. Each of
the six files contributes **exactly one** pilot-only row, each row is the EMF
pair diagnostic above, and each line is a `disjoint from` clause written in a
type declaration — the form the mechanism section pins to `OwnedDisjoining`. The
per-clause table is in
[the row-by-row sweep of pilot-only diagnostics](pilot-differential.md#only-the-pilot--the-row-by-row-sweep-137). The clause appears on classifiers, plain types and features alike and the
reported EMF class tracks the declaration, so the defect is in the pair rather
than in one metaclass; the standalone form `disjoint b.f.a from b.a;`
(`Simple Tests/FeatureChains.kerml:28`) sits in the same file as one of the six
and reports nothing. No `kerml-examples` file carries a second pilot-only row of
any kind, so a fix to the derived `ownedDisjoining` delegate clears this root's
column entirely and silences nothing else it depends on.

### Are the `queryx/failing` query path expressions intended notation? (pilot `2026-05`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. The adjudication is in
[the parser-recovery decisions](adjudications.md).

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** three Xpect fixtures under
`sysml/src/org/omg/sysml/xpect/tests/queryx/failing/` declare file-wide silence
(`// XPECT noErrors ---> ""`) while the pinned release's own validator rejects
them. Is the notation planned for a later version, or are the fixtures kept as a
record of a proposal that the grammar deliberately does not admit?

The forms are

```sysml
value v1_i: Integer[0..*] = .*/.*[Integer];       // QPE-Qualifier
value v_redefining: Integer = ./vehicle_1/cylinders/@redefining;  // QPE-Traversal
value vw_recursive: Integer[0..*] = .**/cylinders;  // QPE-Wildcard
```

Running the release's SysML validator (`jupyter-sysml-kernel-0.60.1-all.jar`,
tag `2026-05`) over the three model bodies reports, among others:

```
QPE-Wildcard.sysml:9:38: error: For input string: "."
QPE-Wildcard.sysml:9:40: error: no viable alternative at input '/'
QPE-Traversal.sysml:7:57: error: no viable alternative at input '@'
QPE-Qualifier.sysml:9:40: error: no viable alternative at input '/'
```

Their `XPECT_SETUP` names `org.omg.sysml.xpect.tests.query.failing.SysMLQueryFailingTest`
while the runner in the directory is `org.omg.sysml.xpect.tests.queryx.failing.SysMLQueryFailingTest`
and extends `KerMLXtextTests`.

A second implementation reading the corpus cannot tell from the fixtures alone
whether the declared silence is an obligation or an aspiration, which is the
reason for asking rather than implementing.

### `validateFeatureOwnedCrossSubsetting` indexes the wrong list and throws (pilot `2026-07`)

Filed as
[Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation#794](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation/issues/794);
the body below is what was submitted. The reproduction is the rejection-corpus case
`tools/referee/reject/testdata/negative/semantic/k42-two-cross-subsettings.kerml`.
Confirmed and fixed upstream: the maintainers reproduced it on 2026-09-05 and
commit `241aea55` (ST6RI-966, "Fixed error message for cross-subsetting
validation check") changed the loop to index `crossSubsettings`. The fix is in
the `2026-08` release (0.62.0) this project now pins, where `validate-kerml`
reports `At most one cross subsetting is allowed` at `k42:9:39`; EMF's
`The opposite features 'crossingFeature' … and 'ownedCrossSubsetting' … do not
refer to each other` is still reported beside it, because
`Feature::ownedCrossSubsetting` remains single-valued and the second
`CrossSubsetting` is still parsed.

````markdown
### A feature with two `crosses` clauses reports `Error executing EValidator`

**Version:** `2026-07` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0, the KerML standalone
setup); the offending lines are unchanged on `master` at `13c32ea2`.

#### Minimal reproduction

```kerml
package K42TwoCrossSubsettings {
    class A {
        feature x : A;
        feature y : A;
    }
    assoc S {
        end a : A;
        end b : A crosses a.x crosses a.y;
    }
}
```

The grammar admits the second `crosses` (`FeatureSpecializationPart` repeats
`FeatureSpecialization`), and `validateFeatureOwnedCrossSubsetting` is meant to
report it as `At most one cross subsetting is allowed`. Instead the validator
reports

```
k42-two-cross-subsettings.kerml:0:0: error: Error executing EValidator
k42-two-cross-subsettings.kerml:9:39: error: The opposite features 'crossingFeature' of '...CrossSubsettingImpl{...@ownedRelationship.2}' and 'ownedCrossSubsetting' of '...FeatureImpl{...}' do not refer to each other
```

The second line is EMF's opposite-consistency check on the extra
`CrossSubsetting` (`Feature::ownedCrossSubsetting` is single-valued), not the
intended constraint message. Dropping the second clause (`end b : A crosses a.x;`)
makes the model validate clean, so the second `crosses` is the only defect.

#### Cause

In `KerMLValidator.checkFeature` (`KerMLValidator.xtend`, the
`validateFeatureOwnedCrossSubsetting` block):

```xtend
val crossSubsettings = f.ownedRelationship.filter[r | r instanceof CrossSubsetting].toList
if (crossSubsettings.size > 1) {
    for (var i = 1; i < crossSubsettings.size; i++)
        error(INVALID_FEATURE_OWNED_CROSS_SUBSETTING_MSG, refSubsettings.get(i), null, INVALID_FEATURE_OWNED_CROSS_SUBSETTING)
}
```

`refSubsettings.get(i)` reads the reference-subsetting list collected for the
`validateFeatureOwnedReferenceSubsetting` check just above; with no `references`
clause on the feature that list is empty and the `get(1)` throws, which Xtext
surfaces as `Error executing EValidator`. The intended target is
`crossSubsettings.get(i)`.

### A non-Boolean transition guard is accepted with the full library loaded (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. The observation is recorded under [constraints the pilot
declares but does not enforce](pilot-rejection.md#constraints-the-pilot-declares-but-does-not-enforce).

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** `validateTransitionFeatureMembershipGuardExpression`
is implemented in `SysMLValidator.checkTransitionFeatureMembership` and
`validation/invalid/TransitionUsage_invalid.sysml.xt` expects its message:

```sysml
transition
    first S2_1
    // XPECT errors ---> "Must be a Boolean expression." at "if \"test\""
    if "test"
    then S2_2;
```

That fixture's `XPECT_SETUP` loads a reduced resource set (`Base`, `Occurrences`,
`Performances`, `States`, ... but not `ScalarValues`). Running the release's
SysML validator (`jupyter-sysml-kernel-0.61.0-all.jar`, tag `2026-07`) with the
full standard library over the same shape reports no error:

```sysml
package T2 {
    state def S2 {
        state S2_1;
        transition first S2_1 if "test" then S2_2;
        state S2_2;
    }
    state def S3 {
        state a;
        state b;
        transition t first a if 1 + 2 then b;
    }
}
```

The same silence covers every other non-Boolean guard tried: `accept … if 1 then`,
`transition if 2.5 then`, an enumeration literal, a part-typed attribute, a `String`-valued
calculation, and the guarded successions of an action body (`first a if "go" then b`, a
decision's `if e then b`).

The cause appears to be `ExpressionAdapter.getRelevantFeatures` (`EXPRESSION_GUARD_FEATURE`):
a transition guard implicitly redefines `TransitionPerformances::TransitionPerformance::guard`,
declared `bool guard[*]`, so `KerMLValidator.isBoolean` finds a `Boolean`-typed result on
every guard by construction and `checkTransitionFeatureMembership` cannot fail. The reduced fixture library
has no `TransitionPerformances`, which is why the Xpect expectation holds there.

Is the guard check intended to fire in a full-library workspace? A second
implementation that rejects `if "test"` with the full library loaded, as the
fixture suggests it should, currently disagrees with the release's validator on
the same text.

### A trigger's time arithmetic is judged by its operator, not its dimension (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. OpenSysML judges the argument by the dimension of its value
(`spec-compliance.md`, the `after`/`at` trigger rows), so the two implementations
disagree on the shapes below in both directions.

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** `SysMLValidator.isDuration` and `isTime`, which
`checkTriggerInvocationExpression` uses for `validateTriggerInvocationActionAfterArgument`
and `…AtArgument`, admit an `OperatorExpression` when its operator is one of
`-`, `+`, `*`, `%`, `^`, `**` and every operand is itself a duration or a time
instant. With the release's validator (`jupyter-sysml-kernel-0.61.0-all.jar`,
tag `2026-07`) and the full standard library:

```sysml
package T {
    private import ISQ::*;
    private import Time::*;
    private import SI::*;
    attribute d : DurationValue;
    attribute t : TimeInstantValue;
    state def S {
        state s1; state s2;
        transition first s1 accept after d * d then s2;             // no error: dimension T²
        transition first s1 accept at t * t then s2;                // no error: dimension T²
        transition first s1 accept after 10 [m] / 2 [m/s] then s2;  // An after expression must be a DurationValue: dimension T
    }
}
```

Is the operator list the intended reading of `checkTriggerInvocationExpressionAfterArgument`
(the argument's result conforms to `ISQ::DurationValue`)? A product of two durations
is not a duration, and a quotient of a length by a speed is one; a second
implementation that judges the value's dimension accepts the last line and
refuses the first two.

### A quantity value is accepted as the unit of a quantity (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. OpenSysML judges the nested quantity by its value type
(`validation-constraints.md`, `validateOperatorExpressionQuantity`), so the two
implementations disagree on the shape below.

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** `SysMLValidator.checkOperatorExpression` judges
the unit of `x [u]` with `resultConformsTo(u, TensorMeasurementReference)`,
which admits an `OperatorExpression` whose declared result is a supertype of
the wanted type when one of its arguments conforms. `BaseFunctions::'['` returns
`Anything`, so a quantity value nested as the unit passes for the measurement
reference it was built from. With the release's validator
(`jupyter-sysml-kernel-0.61.0-all.jar`, tag `2026-07`) and the full standard
library:

```sysml
package Q {
    private import ISQ::*;
    private import SI::*;
    attribute a = 10 [2 [m]];          // no warning: `m` is an argument of `[`
    attribute b = 10 [(m, 3)];         // no warning: `m` is an element
    attribute c = 10 [if true ? m else s];  // Should be a measurement reference (unit).
}
```

Is the existential reading of `resultConformsTo` intended for `[`? `2 [m]` is a
`ScalarQuantityValue`, not a measurement reference, and a second implementation
that judges the value's type warns on `a`; it agrees on `b` (a sequence whose
elements are units) and on `c` (the branches of a conditional are expression
bodies, so its result is `Anything` and no argument is a unit).

### Eight control-node succession constraints are unimplemented `TODO`s (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. The rules are implemented on our side by
`internal/check/passes/control_node.go` and refereed against the specification
text; the adjudication is in
[pilot-differential.md](pilot-differential.md#control-node-successions-the-pilot-does-not-validate).

````markdown
### `SysMLValidator` does not check the succession constraints on control nodes

**Version:** `2026-07` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0, `validate-sysml-batch` over the
shipped standard library).

SysML v2 8.3.17 (`ControlNode`, `DecisionNode`, `ForkNode`, `JoinNode`, `MergeNode`)
declares nine validation constraints. `SysMLValidator.xtend` (`:857–888`) declares an
error code for each, but implements only `validateControlNodeOwningType`; the other
eight are `// TODO: Check validate… (?)` comments in otherwise empty `@Check` methods:
`validateControlNodeIncomingSuccessions`, `validateControlNodeOutgoingSuccessions`,
`validateDecisionNodeIncomingSuccessions`, `validateDecisionNodeOutgoingSuccessions`,
`validateForkNodeIncomingSuccessions`, `validateJoinNodeOutgoingSuccessions`,
`validateMergeNodeIncomingSuccessions`, `validateMergeNodeOutgoingSuccessions`.

#### Minimal reproduction

```sysml
package ForkTwoIncoming {
    action def A {
        action a;
        action b;
        action c;
        fork f;
        first a then f;
        first b then f;
        first f then c;
    }
}
```

`f` has two incoming successions; `validateForkNodeIncomingSuccessions`
(`targetConnector->selectByKind(Succession)->size() <= 1`, SysML v2 8.3.17 `ForkNode`) is
violated.

#### Expected

An error on `fork f`.

#### Actual

No diagnostics. The same holds for a join or merge node with two outgoing successions, a
decision node with two incoming ones, and for the end multiplicities — `succession s first
[0..1] a then [1] m;` into a merge is accepted where `validateMergeNodeIncomingSuccessions`
requires source multiplicity `0..1`, and `succession s first a then [0..1] f;` into a fork
is accepted where `validateControlNodeIncomingSuccessions` requires target multiplicity
`1..1`.

#### Note

The grammar admits every one of these models, and the specification says the rules "shall
be enforced in the abstract syntax, even if not shown explicitly in the concrete syntax
notation for a model" (7.17.3), so a validator is the only place they can be caught. One
reading question may be behind the `(?)` on the `TODO` lines: `multiplicityHasBounds`
requires `mult <> null`, and a connector end written without a multiplicity (`first a then
f;`) is given none by the pilot's `SuccessionAdapter`/`ConnectorAdapter`, so a literal evaluation of the four
multiplicity constraints would reject the specification's own examples. Treating an
unwritten end multiplicity as the required one, and checking only written ones, is what a
second implementation has to assume; a note in the release on the intended reading would
help.

### A bound naming a package-level feature is rejected whatever its type (pilot `2026-07`)

Filed as
[Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation#803](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation/issues/803);
the body below is what was submitted. Reproduced with
`validate-kerml` at `2026-07` (0.61.0) and again at `2026-08` (0.62.0); the
lines cited are unchanged on `master` at `5cca16d8` (2026-09-12). OpenSysML
reads the referenced feature's declared type
(`internal/check/passes/w8c_multiplicity_bounds.go`) wherever the feature is
owned and rejects only a bound whose type does not conform to `Integer`; the
adjudication is in
[pilot-differential.md](pilot-differential.md#multiplicity-bound-result-types-round).

````markdown
### `validateMultiplicityRangeResultTypes` rejects a bound that names a package-level feature, and accepts the same bound inside a type

**Version:** `2026-08` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.62.0, `validate-kerml` over the shipped
standard library); the lines cited are unchanged on `master` at `5cca16d8`.

#### Minimal reproduction

```kerml
package P {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    feature k : Natural;
    feature d [k];
    class T {
        feature k : Natural;
        feature d [k];
    }
}
```

#### Expected

No diagnostics. Both `k` are typed by `ScalarValues::Natural`, so under KerML 1.1 8.3.3.6
(`validateMultiplicityRangeBoundResultTypes`: each bound's `result` conforms to `Natural`, the
lower bound possibly to `Integer`) both `[k]` are well formed — or, if a bound must evaluate to a
literal, both should be rejected alike.

#### Actual

```
bound.kerml:4:16: error: Must have a Natural value
```

at the package-level `feature d [k];` only; the same two lines inside `T` validate clean. The
type-based path does work where it is taken: `class T { feature ks : String; feature ds [ks]; }`
is rejected with the same message, as it should be.

#### Cause

`KerMLValidator.checkMultiplicityRange`:

```xtend
// TODO: Correct validateMultiplicityBoundResults OCL from KERML-199.
// validateMultiplicityRangeBoundResultTypes
for (b: mult.bound) {
    if (if (b.isModelLevelEvaluable) mult.valueOf(b) == -2 else !b.isInteger) {
        error(INVALID_MULTIPLICITY_RANGE_BOUND_RESULT_TYPES_MSG, b, null, INVALID_MULTIPLICITY_RANGE_BOUND_RESULT_TYPES)
    }
}
```

The bound is judged one of two ways depending on where its referent lives.
`FeatureReferenceExpression_modelLevelEvaluable_InvocationDelegate` answers `true` for a
reference to a feature that has no featuring type and no value expression (the package-level
`k`), and `false` for a reference to a type's member (`T::k`, which is featured by `T`).

- Inside `T` the bound is not model-level evaluable, so `isInteger` judges it by the referent's
  type, `Natural`, and it passes.
- At package level the bound is model-level evaluable, so `MultiplicityRange.valueOf` evaluates
  it: `evaluate` yields the referenced feature itself rather than a `LiteralInteger`, `valueOf`
  returns its `-2` null marker, and the error fires — whatever `k`'s type is (`Integer` and
  `Positive` are rejected the same way).

The declared type of the referent is never consulted on the evaluable path, so a package-level
feature can never be used as a bound, while the identical declaration one level down is accepted.

#### Suggested fix

Judge the bound by its `result` type on both paths, as the constraint is written: fall back to
`isInteger`/`isNatural` when evaluation does not produce a literal, and report only when the
referent's type does not conform. If instead a bound is required to evaluate to a literal, the
member case should be rejected too, and the message should say the bound is not evaluable rather
than that it lacks a Natural value.

### A multiplicity is found through aliases and references (pilot `2026-07`)

Filed as
[Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation#802](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation/issues/802);
the body below is what was submitted. It covers both symptoms
of the one delegate — the feature-side `validateFeatureMultiplicityDomain`
and the classifier-side `validateClassifierMultiplicityDomain` — in one report.
Reproduced with `validate-kerml` at `2026-07` (0.61.0) and again at `2026-08`
(0.62.0); the delegate is unchanged on `master` at `5cca16d8` (2026-09-12).
OpenSysML derives a type's multiplicity from its owned members only, so neither
model below draws a diagnostic; the census rows for both constraints in
[validation-constraints.md](validation-constraints.md) record the difference
(`validateClassifierMultiplicityDomain` as deliberately declined,
`validateFeatureMultiplicityDomain` as not implemented).

Not part of the report: the standalone `featuring of C::k::m by D;` on a
feature's owned multiplicity, which is the one spec-genuine violation of
`validateFeatureMultiplicityDomain`, is accepted by the pilot because
`Feature_featuringType_SettingDelegate` reads only `ownedTypeFeaturing`, and by
OpenSysML because it does not enforce the rule. That is a separate question and
stays in the census row.

````markdown
### `Type::multiplicity` is derived through alias and reference memberships, so both multiplicity-domain checks fire on valid models

**Version:** `2026-08` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.62.0, `validate-kerml` over the shipped
standard library); `Type_multiplicity_SettingDelegate` is unchanged on `master` at `5cca16d8`.

#### Minimal reproduction

```kerml
package P {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    class T;
    class K { feature f : T { multiplicity m [1..2]; } }
    class C { alias m for K::f::m; }
    class E {
        multiplicity em [1..4];
        feature k : Integer { alias a for em; }
        feature v : Natural = em;
    }
}
```

#### Expected

No diagnostics. None of `C`, `k` or `v` owns a multiplicity: `C` and `k` each own an alias
`Membership` whose `memberElement` is a multiplicity owned elsewhere, and `v` owns a
`FeatureValue` whose `FeatureReferenceExpression` reaches `em` through a reference `Membership`.
KerML 1.1 8.3.3.1 derives `Type::multiplicity` as `ownedMember->selectByKind(Multiplicity)->any(true)`,
and `ownedMember` is `ownedMembership.ownedMemberElement` — the members of `OwningMembership`s
only. An alias or reference membership has no `ownedMemberElement`, so all three types have an
empty `multiplicity`, and both `validateClassifierMultiplicityDomain` and
`validateFeatureMultiplicityDomain` are satisfied.

#### Actual

```
alias.kerml:5:5: error: Multiplicity must not have a featuring type
alias.kerml:8:9: error: Multiplicity must have same featuring types as it feature
alias.kerml:9:31: error: Multiplicity must have same featuring types as it feature
```

The same alias inside a subclass (`class F :> K { alias mf for f::m; }`) and inside a `struct`
are reported alike.

#### Cause

`org.omg.sysml.logic` `Type_multiplicity_SettingDelegate.getMultiplicityOf`:

```java
return (Multiplicity)type.getOwnedMembership().stream().
        map(Membership::getMemberElement).
        filter(Multiplicity.class::isInstance).
        findFirst().orElse(null);
```

maps every `ownedMembership` — alias and reference memberships included — through
`Membership::getMemberElement`, so the first `Multiplicity` reachable through any membership
becomes the type's own. For `C` that is `K::f::m`, a multiplicity featured by `f`, and
`KerMLValidator.checkClassifier` reports its featuring type; for `k` and `v` it is `em`, a
classifier multiplicity with no featuring type, and `checkFeature` reports that it differs from
the feature's `{E}`.

This is the same mistake fixed in `TypeUtil.addMultiplicityTo` by #708, where a nested alias was
counted as an existing multiplicity: an alias membership is an `ownedMembership` but not an
`OwningMembership`, so its member is not an owned member of the type.

#### Suggested fix

Derive `multiplicity` from `ownedMember` (equivalently, filter `ownedMembership` to
`OwningMembership` and read `ownedMemberElement`) as 8.3.3.1 does:

```java
return type.getOwnedMembership().stream().
        filter(OwningMembership.class::isInstance).
        map(m -> ((OwningMembership) m).getOwnedMemberElement()).
        filter(Multiplicity.class::isInstance).
        map(Multiplicity.class::cast).
        findFirst().orElse(null);
```

### A connector inheriting a third end is given the binary base (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. OpenSysML counts a declaration's effective ends — owned and
inherited — when choosing between `Links::links` and `Links::binaryLinks`
(`internal/semantic/semantics/implicit.go`, `connector.go`); the adjudication is in
[pilot-differential.md](pilot-differential.md#binary-link-specialization-round).

````markdown
### `ConnectorAdapter.getDefaultSupertype` makes a connector with an inherited third end binary

**Version:** `2026-07` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0, `validate-kerml` over the shipped
standard library).

```kerml
package P {
    class T;
    assoc N { end a : T; end b : T; end c : T; }
    assoc B specializes N { end redefines a : T; end redefines b : T; }
    class C {
        feature x : T; feature y : T; feature z : T;
        connector m : N { end redefines a references x; end redefines b references y; }
    }
}
```

reports `Cannot have more than two ends` at line 7 (`connector m`) and accepts line 4
(`assoc B`). Both declarations own two ends that redefine `a` and `b` and inherit `c`, so each
has three ends. `ConnectorAdapter.getDefaultSupertype` chooses between `Links::links` and
`Links::binaryLinks` by `TypeUtil.getOwnedEndFeaturesOf(target).size()`, which is two, so `m`
implicitly subsets `binaryLinks`; `checkConnectorBinarySpecialization` then finds three
`connectorEnd`s on a `BinaryLink`-conforming connector and reports the error. KerML 1.1
8.3.4.5.3 (`validateConnectorBinarySpecialization`) implies `Links::binaryLinks` only when
`connectorEnd->size() = 2`, and `connectorEnd` includes inherited ends, so the specification
leaves `m` n-ary. `AssociationAdapter` counts owned ends the same way, but
`checkAssociationBinarySpecialization` inspects owned ends only, so `B` escapes. Should the
adapters count the derived `connectorEnd`/`associationEnd` rather than the owned end features,
or is a subtype meant to redefine every end of its general?

### `OccurrenceFunctions` are evaluated over declarations rather than occurrences (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. OpenSysML's own semantics for the six functions are recorded in
[spec-compliance.md](spec-compliance.md) (the *Occurrences have a lifetime* rows).

The probe model and the pinned evaluator's verbatim answers
(`jupyter-sysml-kernel-0.61.0-all.jar`, tag `2026-07`, through
`build/pilot-evaluator/eval-sysml --cases`; the evaluator exited 0, every answer is
its own):

```sysml
package OccProbe {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    private import OccurrenceFunctions::*;
    private import SequenceFunctions::*;
    part def Widget { attribute mass : Real = 1.0; }
    part w1 : Widget;
    part w2 : Widget;
    part group : Widget[0..*] ordered nonunique;
}
```

| Expression | Pilot answer |
|---|---|
| `OccProbe::w1 === OccProbe::w1` | `LiteralBoolean true` |
| `OccProbe::w1 === OccProbe::w2` | `LiteralBoolean false` |
| `OccProbe::w1 !== OccProbe::w2` | `LiteralBoolean true` |
| `BaseFunctions::'==='(OccProbe::w1, OccProbe::w1)` | `LiteralBoolean true` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::'==='(OccProbe::w1, OccProbe::w1)` | `LiteralBoolean false` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::'==='(OccProbe::w1, OccProbe::w2)` | `LiteralBoolean false` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::'==='(null, null)` | `LiteralBoolean true` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::isDuring(OccProbe::w1)` | `LiteralBoolean true` |

| `OccurrenceFunctions::isDuring("x")` | `LiteralBoolean true` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::create(OccProbe::w1)` | `PartUsage w1` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::create(1)` | `LiteralInteger 1` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::destroy(OccProbe::w1)` | `PartUsage w1` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::destroy(null)` | (nothing) |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::addNew(OccProbe::group, OccProbe::w1)` | `PartUsage w1` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::addNewAt(OccProbe::group, OccProbe::w1, 1)` | `PartUsage w1` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::addNewAt(OccProbe::group, OccProbe::w1, 5)` | `PartUsage w1` |
| `OccurrenceFunctions::addNewAt((1, 2), 3, 9)` | `LiteralInteger 3` |
| `SequenceFunctions::includingAt((1, 2), 3, 5)` | `EXCEPTION:java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: toIndex = 4` |

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** the interactive evaluator answers the
`OccurrenceFunctions` declarations by folding their declared bodies over the
model elements the arguments name, which gives answers that contradict its own
operators. With `part w1 : Widget;` in scope, `w1 === w1` and
`BaseFunctions::'==='(w1, w1)` are `true` but `OccurrenceFunctions::'==='(w1, w1)`
is `false` — the body `x.portionOfLife == y.portionOfLife` is evaluated over
features that hold no value. `isDuring(1)` and `isDuring("x")` are `true`: the
body `notEmpty(during)` is evaluated over the function's own `during` feature
rather than the argument's lifetime, so a data value that is no occurrence is
reported as happening during. `create`, `destroy`, `addNew` and `addNewAt` answer
their `occ` argument for any argument, an `addNewAt` index past the group's end
included, while `SequenceFunctions::includingAt` with the same index throws
`IndexOutOfBoundsException`. Is the evaluator intended to answer these six at all
outside an executing performance? If so, is `OccurrenceFunctions::'==='` intended
to agree with the `===` operator, and `isDuring` to reject an argument that is
not an `Occurrence`, as the declared parameter types say?
````

### An invocation leaving an input parameter unbound validates clean (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream, to the pilot or to any model's repository. OpenSysML has
adjudicated the pilot's behaviour as the specification's reading (see the row
above), so this is a request to confirm that reading, not a defect report.

````markdown
**Question, not a bug report:** is an `InvocationExpression` that leaves an
input parameter of the invoked type unbound — no argument, no `default`, lower
multiplicity bound 1 — meant to validate clean? KerML 8.3.4.8.8 constrains the
arguments an invocation *writes* (`validateInvocationExpressionParameterRedefinition`,
`validateInvocationExpressionNoDuplicateParameterRedefinition`) and states no
constraint on the parameters it leaves out, so we read the omission as a property
of the instance the expression describes (the parameter has no value) rather than
of the expression, and report it as an advisory only. Is that the intended reading?

With `jupyter-sysml-kernel-0.61.0-all.jar` (tag `2026-07`), the SysML and KerML
validators report nothing for any of these:

```sysml
calc def F { in x : Real; in y : Real; return : Real = x + y; }
calc def One { in x : Real; in y : Real [1]; return : Real = x + y; }
calc def Many { in x : Real; in y : Real [1..*]; return : Real = x; }
action def Act { in a : Real; in b : Real; out r : Real; }
part def P { attribute p : Real; attribute q : Real; }

attribute f0 = F();              attribute f1 = F(1.0);
attribute fn1 = F(x = 1.0);      attribute fn2 = F(y = 2.0);
attribute one1 = One(1.0);       attribute many1 = Many(1.0);
attribute act0 = Act().r;        attribute act1 = Act(1.0).r;
ref c0 = new P();                attribute c1c = new P(1.0).q;
```

The only diagnostic on the probe is the one expected of the argument past the
last parameter:

```
arity.sysml:38:32: error: Must correspond to one input parameter of the invoked type   -- F(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
arity.kerml:30:30: error: Must correspond to one input parameter of the invoked type   -- the KerML twin
```

The release's evaluator (`eval-sysml`) forms and evaluates the same calls, so
the expression is treated as well formed end to end:

```
F(1.0)        -> OperatorExpression +      F(1.0, 2.0)  -> LiteralRational 3.0
F(x = 1.0)    -> OperatorExpression +      D(1.0)       -> LiteralRational 2.0   (in y default 1.0)
F(y = 2.0)    -> OperatorExpression +      Opt(1.0)     -> LiteralRational 1.0   (in y [0..1])
F()           -> OperatorExpression +
```

A model author would presumably still want to hear about `F(1.0)`: the public
`airbus/apollo-11-sysml-v2` model (commit `6e9c93f`) computes
`isp * g0 * ln(m0 / mf)` against a two-input `naturalLogarithm` and
`calculateDeltaV(isp, initialMass, finalMass)` against four inputs, and both
validate clean. Is an advisory the pilot would consider, or is silence the
intended reading?

### A conjugated classifier is judged against its generic default only (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. OpenSysML checks a conjugated classifier against every default
base its kind and end count imply (`internal/check/passes/w11e_implicit_base.go`);
the census row (`validateClassifierDefaultSupertype` in
[validation-constraints.md](validation-constraints.md)) records the difference as
⚠️ approximate.

````markdown
### `checkClassifier` validates a conjugated association against `Links::Link` but not `Links::BinaryLink`

**Version:** `2026-07` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0, `validate-kerml` over the shipped
standard library).

```kerml
package P {
    class T;
    assoc struct AS ~ Objects::LinkObject { end feature a : T[1]; end feature b : T[1]; }
    assoc A ~ Links::Link { end feature a : T[1]; end feature b : T[1]; }
    interaction I ~ Links::Link { end feature a : T[1]; end feature b : T[1]; }
}
```

validates clean. A conjugated type owns no specialization
(`validateSpecializationSpecificNotConjugated`) and `TypeAdapter.computeImplicitGeneralTypes`
adds none for it, so the only supertypes these three have are the ones reached through the
conjugated type. `checkClassifier` tests
`ImplicitGeneralizationMap.getDefaultSupertypeFor(c.getClass())`, the `base` entry alone —
`Objects::LinkObject`, `Links::Link`, and for `InteractionImpl` (a Java subclass of
`AssociationImpl`) again `Links::Link` — all satisfied here. KerML 1.1 8.3.4.7
`checkAssociationBinarySpecialization` and `checkAssociationStructureBinarySpecialization`
require a two-end association to specialize `Links::BinaryLink` / `Objects::BinaryLinkObject`,
and an interaction is a performance as well as a link (7.4.10.2), so it must reach
`Performances::Performance` too; none of these declarations do. Is the direct check
meant to cover only the generic default, leaving the `binary` and behavioral bases to the
implicit-specialization machinery that conjugation switches off?

### Repeated anonymous `perform a;` members are distinguishable or not by whether they have bodies (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream. OpenSysML reports the two `Duplicate of … member name` warnings
on every repeated anonymous performed or exhibited use (`internal/semantic/resolve/distinguishability.go`),
as the pilot does when the uses have bodies; the Name Resolution map in
[spec-compliance.md](spec-compliance.md) records the bodiless case as a pilot
artefact.

````markdown
### `validateNamespaceDistinguishability` misses repeated anonymous performed uses unless they have bodies

**Version:** `2026-07` (`jupyter-sysml-kernel` 0.61.0, `validate-sysml-batch`; each file run four
times with the same result).

```sysml
package P {
    part def H { action a; }
    part h : H { perform a; }                                   // (1)
    part h2 : H { perform a; perform a; }                       // (2)
    part h3 : H { perform a; perform a; perform a; }            // (3)
    part h4 : H { perform a { attribute i; } perform a { attribute j; } }   // (4)
    part h5 : H { perform a { attribute i; } perform a; }       // (5)
    part h6 : H { exhibit s; exhibit s; }                       // (6), with `state s;` in H
}
```

Each `perform a;` is an unnamed `PerformActionUsage` whose effective name is `a`, the name of
the action it references (KerML 7.3.4.5, SysML v2 7.16.4), so every one of them duplicates the
inherited `H::a` and, where repeated, its siblings. With each `part` in a file of its own next to
`H`:

- (1) `warning: Duplicate of inherited member name 'a' from H` at the `perform` — as expected;
- (4) and (5) `Duplicate of other owned member name` **and** `Duplicate of inherited member name
  'a' from H` on each of the two uses — as expected;
- (2) and (6) **no warning at all**, the inherited duplicate of (1) included;
- (3) a single `Duplicate of inherited member name 'a' from H` on the *third* use only.

The KerML spellings behave consistently: `feature :>> a; feature :>> a;` reports the two
owned duplicates with or without bodies, and `feature ::> a;` never names anything. The
SysML result appears to depend on the order in which the effective names are computed while
the references are still being linked — computing `memberName` for one use resolves `a` in
`h2`, which asks the sibling use for *its* `memberName`, which resolves `a` again — rather than
on anything in the model. Is the bodiless outcome intended, or should (2), (3) and (6) report
what (4) and (5) do?

## Defects in the PSSM test suite

This section records defects in the **OMG PSSM test suite** (`PSSM_TestSuite.xmi`, the UML
2.5 XMI file of 103 state-machine tests that [the PSSM referee](pssm-referee.md) translates
and runs). A row lands here only when the suite's registered expectation contradicts the
suite's own statement of the test's intent or the semantics it claims to test, established from
the file's contents — or, for two tests of one shape, contradicts the expectation registered for
the other; a test the runtime merely fails is the referee's business, not this
page's. The suite is downloaded, digest-checked and never vendored, so a defect here is
documented without a correction: the referee runs the suite as published, and the record
adjudicates the test on the traces the suite registers.

| *Transition 017* | eight admitted traces, two of which — `T2(effect)::S1(entry)::T2.2(effect)::T3.2(effect)::S3.1(doActivity)::T3.1.2(effect)` and `…::T2.2(effect)::T3.2(effect)::T3.1.2(effect)::S3.1(doActivity)` — have `T3.2`, the completion transition out of `S3.1`, fire before `T3.1.2`, the completion transition inside `S3.1`'s own region, and run `S3.1`'s do activity after it | a composite state completes when its regions have reached their final states, so its completion transition cannot precede a transition of its region; the suite's own "Expected execution sequence" comment on the test's state machine fires `T3.2` when the completion event `S3.1` generates is consumed, *after* the inner region's `T3.1.2` and final state — the six other traces, not these two | `StatePerformances.kerml`: `private succession [*] transitionLinkSource.nonDoMiddle then [1] Performance::self;` on `StateTransitionPerformance` orders a transition out of a state after every non-do middle step of the state, the nested region's transition performances among them; `private succession [*] middle then [1] exit;` orders every middle step, the do activity included, before the state's exit. No reading of either admits `T3.2(effect)` before `T3.1.2(effect)` | **not filed**; documented without a correction — the test stays `fail` in the referee on these two traces alone, adjudicated in [the referee record](pssm-referee.md) |
| *Exiting 002* | one admitted trace, `S1(doActivityPartI)::S1(exit)`, the do activity's first segment before the dispatch of the tester's `Continue` that leaves `S1` | the suite has a do activity evolve on its own thread of execution, and registers both orders of the same segment against the same dispatch for *Behavior 003 A*; `S1(exit)` alone, the dispatch first, is not registered here | the second order is the suite's own reading one test earlier; the test's point, the exit aborting the do activity, holds in both | documented, not corrected: `fail` in the referee while `S1(exit)` is the only reached trace not admitted |
| *History 001-C*, *History 002-B* | twelve and six admitted traces, each set the product of the orders registered for the test's two halves — the first entry of the parallel `S1`, then its re-entry through the history pseudostate of region 2 after `AnotherSignal`. The two halves are structurally identical between the tests (`S2.1` carries an exit action and `T2.2.2` an effect in *002-B*, labels only) and the registered orders differ: *001-C* admits `S2.2(entry)::S1.1(exit)::S1.2(entry)::S2.2.1(exit)::S2.2.2(entry)` for the first half and *002-B* does not admit its counterpart, while *002-B* admits `S2.1(exit)::S2.2(entry)::S2.2.1(exit)::T2.2.2(effect)::S2.2.2(entry)::S1.1(exit)::S1.2(entry)` and *001-C* does not admit its; for the second half *001-C* admits `S1.1(exit)::S2.2(entry)::S1.2(entry)::S2.2.2(entry)`, the firing of `T1.2` split around a restored entry, and *002-B* admits no split; and both admit `S1.1(exit)::S1.2(entry)` before or between region 2's restored entries | the specification's own descriptions of the two tests (PSSM 1.0 §9.3.15.4 and §9.3.15.7) end the RTC step that restores region 2 with `S1.1`'s completion event *pending* and fire `T1.2` in the next step, and §8.5.9 dispatches completion events in the order they were generated: `S2.2.1`'s completion, generated a step after `S1.1`'s, cannot be dispatched before it, and whichever region is entered first, its completion is dispatched first. Read by that text, *001-C* admits two of its twelve traces and *002-B* two of its six and two it does not register | `StatePerformances.kerml` orders a state's `entry` before its `middle` and a transition out of a state after its source's non-do middle steps, and nothing across regions; it neither orders one region's completion transition against a sibling region's entry nor forbids it, so the split firing is not excluded by the library — it is excluded by PSSM's own run-to-completion step, which the two tests describe alike and register differently | **not filed**; documented without a correction — both tests stay `fail` in the referee, adjudicated in [the referee record](pssm-referee.md); no runtime rule reaches either registered set without reaching traces the other test refuses |

### PSSM Transition 017 admits a parent's completion before its region's

The test enters the parallel state `S1`, whose third region holds the composite `S3.1` with a
do activity (`S3.1(doActivity)`), a region of its own whose single state `S3.1.1` completes
into a final state through `T3.1.2` (`T3.1.2(effect)`), and a completion transition `T3.2`
(`T3.2(effect)`) out of `S3.1`; the second region's `S2.1` completes through `T2.2`
(`T2.2(effect)`). The eight traces the suite registers for the test (the `expectedTraces` of
`t017` in the `TransitionTests` activity) are orders of `T2.2(effect)`, `S3.1(doActivity)`,
`T3.1.2(effect)` and `T3.2(effect)` after `T2(effect)::S1(entry)`, `T3.2` last or after
`T2.2` in each: six have `T3.1.2` before `T3.2`, and two have `T3.2` before `T3.1.2`, with
the do activity's step after `T3.2`.

The suite's own comment on `Transition017_Test`'s state machine, quoted from the XMI:

```text
Expected execution sequence
- Initial  - T1 - waiting - T2 (when Start gets consumed) - S1(entry) {
	…
	||
       Initial - S3.1(doActivity){
	   - Initial  - T3.1.1 - S3.1.1 - T3.1.2 - FinalState
	}
       T3.2 (when completion event generated by S3.1 gets consumed) - FinalState
}
Note:
 - What is shown here is that T3 cannot be fired before that all of the three regions of
   composite state S1 have completed.  Only at this time a completion event is generated by
   S1, this latter is used by T3 to fire.
```

`T3.2` fires when `S3.1`'s completion event is consumed, and `S3.1` — a composite state with a
region — generates it once that region reaches its final state, after `T3.1.2`; the very rule
the note states for `T3` and `S1` one level up. The two traces contradict the comment, and
they contradict the semantic library the test is meant to exercise: `StatePerformances.kerml`
orders a transition out of a state after every non-do middle step of the state it leaves
(`private succession [*] transitionLinkSource.nonDoMiddle then [1] Performance::self;`), and
a nested state's transitions are middle steps of the state that encloses them, so `T3.2`'s
performance follows `T3.1.2`'s; and it orders every middle step, the do activity among them,
before the state's exit (`private succession [*] middle then [1] exit;`), so the do activity
cannot take its step after `S3.1` has been left. A completion check made when `S3.1` is
entered, before its region's initial transition has fired, would produce both traces and is
the likely origin; nothing in the suite says so.

The suite is downloaded by `./scripts/download-pssm-suite.sh` under a pinned digest and is
not vendored, so the two traces are not corrected: the referee reads the suite as published,
reports *Transition 017* `fail` while they are the only admitted traces not reached, and
[the referee record](pssm-referee.md) adjudicates the test on that reason. Nothing has been
posted upstream.

### PSSM Exiting 002 registers one of the two orders the suite admits elsewhere

The test enters `S1`, whose do activity traces `S1(doActivityPartI)`, accepts a signal and
traces `S1(doActivityPartII)`, and whose exit behavior traces `S1(exit)`; the tester's
`Continue`, in the pool as `S1` is entered, fires the transition out of `S1`, and the exit aborts
the do activity. The suite registers one trace, `S1(doActivityPartI)::S1(exit)`: the do
activity's first segment before the dispatch of `Continue`.

The suite's own account of a do activity, from *Deferred 006*'s rationale, quoted from the XMI:

```text
A doActivity behavior evolves on its own thread of execution.
```

A segment on its own thread and a dispatch on the machine's are unordered, and the suite
registers them so one test earlier: *Behavior 003 A*, the same `S1` with an entry behavior in
place of the exit behavior and the tester's `AnotherSignal` in place of `Continue`, admits both
`S1(entry)::S1(doActivityPartI)` and `S1(entry)` — the dispatch before the first segment,
which the transition's effect then never lets run. *Exiting 002*'s expected execution is the
same race with the exit behavior in the trace, and `S1(exit)` alone, the dispatch first, is
the order *Behavior 003 A* admits and this test does not register; its own note contemplates
the do activity's timing (`If the doActivity was still running at the time where the exit
behavior is executed …`) and registers one order all the same. The test's point — the exit
aborts the do activity, so `S1(doActivityPartII)` never traces — holds in both orders.

The suite is not vendored, so the missing trace is not added: the referee reports *Exiting 002*
`fail` while `S1(exit)` is the only reached trace not admitted, and
[the referee record](pssm-referee.md) adjudicates the test on that reason. Nothing has been
posted upstream.

### PSSM History 001-C and 002-B admit a completion inside the restore and contradict each other

Both tests enter the parallel state `S1`, whose region 1 runs `S1.1` (no behavior) into `S1.2`
through the completion transition `T1.2` and whose region 2 runs `S2.1` into the composite
`S2.2`, itself running `S2.2.1` into `S2.2.2`; `AnotherSignal` leaves `S1` and re-enters it
through a history pseudostate in region 2 — deep in *001-C*, which restores `S2.2.2`; shallow
in *002-B*, which restores `S2.2` and runs its initial transition to `S2.2.1` — while region 1
starts again from its initial pseudostate at `S1.1`. Between the tests, region 1 and the first
unit of region 2's restore are identical; *002-B* adds an exit action to `S2.1` and an effect to
`T2.2.2`, which only add labels to the trace. Each test's registered set (the `expectedTraces`
of `h001c` and `h002b` in the `HistoryTests` activity) is a product of the orders it registers
for the first entry of `S1` and for the re-entry: two by six for *001-C*, two by three for
*002-B*.

The specification describes the two tests alike. Its text for *History 001-C* (§9.3.15.4):

```text
As a result, the left region starts its execution from the initial pseudostate while the
right region is restored to its last recorded configuration […]. This completes the step
started by the firing of T4. When dispatched, the completion event occurrence generated by
S1.1 triggers T1.2.
```

and for *History 002-B* (§9.3.15.7):

```text
At the end of the RTC step initiated by dispatching of the AnotherSignal event occurrence,
the state machine is in configuration S1[S1.1, S2.2[S2.2.1]]. The next step consists in the
firing of T1.2 upon the dispatching of the completion event occurrence generated by S1.1. At
this point, the only remaining event occurrence in the event pool is the completion event
occurrence generated for S2.2.1.
```

That is §8.5.7.4's restoration — a restored or default-entered state that is complete places a
`CompletionEventOccurrence` in the pool, the regions are "restored concurrently", and the step
ends — with §8.5.9's pool: "a new `CompletionEventOccurrence` is placed into the (ordered)
`eventPool` behind any `CompletionEventOccurrences` already in the pool". Read by that text the
re-entry has one order in *001-C*, `S2.2(entry)::S2.2.2(entry)::S1.1(exit)::S1.2(entry)`, and
two in *002-B*, `S1.1`'s completion and `S2.2.1`'s dispatched in either order after the restore;
and the first entry of `S1` has two orders in each test, `S1.1`'s completion or `S2.1`'s
dispatched first according to which region was entered first, `S2.2.1`'s — generated only when
`S2.1`'s completion transition has entered it, a step later — behind both.

The registered sets say otherwise, and differently. *001-C* registers six re-entry orders, five
of which fire `T1.2` inside the restoring step, before or between `S2.2(entry)` and
`S2.2.2(entry)`, three of them with `S2.2(entry)` between `S1.1(exit)` and `S1.2(entry)`.
*002-B* registers three, one of which fires `T1.2` inside the restoring step and none of which
splits it. For the first entry *001-C* registers the two orders the pool gives; *002-B*
registers `S1.1`'s completion first, and then `S2.1(exit)::S2.2(entry)` first followed by
`S2.2.1`'s completion *before* `S1.1`'s — an order §8.5.9 excludes, since `S1.1`'s event was in
the pool a step earlier — and not the order the pool gives when region 2 is entered first,
which is *001-C*'s. The two tests therefore contradict each other on identical halves, and
each contradicts the specification's description of itself: *001-C* registers twelve traces
of which two agree with that description; *002-B* registers six of which two agree, and omits
the two others the description gives. An implementation that dispatches a default-entered
state's completion while the sibling region's restore is still under way would produce the
in-restore orders, and one that checks a state's completion at the wrong moment would
produce *002-B*'s inversion; nothing in the suite says so.

The suite is not vendored, so the sets are not corrected: the referee reads them as
published and reports both tests `fail`, and [the referee record](pssm-referee.md) adjudicates
them on that reason. The runtime adopts no rule to reach either registered set — none reaches
one without reaching traces the other test refuses — and by the specification's own text
neither test can reach `pass` against the published expectations. Nothing has been posted
upstream.

## The errata overlay entries for these models

The second section's rows are also entries of the declared errata overlay
(`tools/oracle/errata`, [the declared errata overlay](errata-overlay.md)): the published bytes on
disk are never edited, and a row that carries a correction has that correction
applied to the *second* figure every oracle reports, never to the headline one.
The overlay adds no category and reclassifies nothing — the two quantity rows stay the adjudicated
commensurability family recorded in the false-positive audit.

An entry is accepted only with a specification citation and a written
derivation, and only while its as-published text still matches the corpus on
disk; both are tests (`tools/oracle/errata`), not conventions. A defect with no
unambiguous intended reading is documented **without** a correction rather than
closed by a guess.

| Finding | File | Line | Citation | Overlay | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| dimensionless addend | `sysml-examples/Geometry Examples/VehicleGeometryAndCoordinateFrames.sysml` | 38 | SysML v2 §9.8.9.1 | corrected | **not filed** — drafted below, awaiting maintainer authorisation |
| mismatched dimensions | `sysml-examples/Analysis Examples/Turbojet Stage Analysis.sysml` | 25 | SysML v2 §9.8.9.1 | documented without a correction | **not filed** — drafted below, awaiting maintainer authorisation |
| a return typed by a dimension its value does not have | `sysml-examples/Analysis Examples/Dynamics.sysml` | 13 | KerML 7.4.9 | documented without a correction | **not filed** — drafted below, awaiting maintainer authorisation |
| non-conforming redefinition | `sysml-examples/Individuals Examples/AnalysisIndividualExample.sysml` | 86 | KerML 7.4.9, 8.3.4.2 | retired at `2026-07` | **closed** — fixed upstream, never filed by us |

Filing is the user's decision: nothing here has been posted to
`Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation` or any other upstream repository.

### `radius = 22/2*25.4 + 110 [mm]` adds a dimensionless value to a length (pilot `2026-05`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Published, `Geometry Examples/VehicleGeometryAndCoordinateFrames.sysml`:38:

```sysml
:>> radius = 22/2*25.4 + 110 [mm];
```

Corrected by the overlay:

```sysml
:>> radius = (22/2*25.4 + 110) [mm];
```

`'[' SequenceExpression ']'` is a postfix on `PrimaryExpression`
(`build/pilot-grammars/KerMLExpressions.xtext:308`), below `AdditiveExpression`,
so `[mm]` qualifies `110` alone and the `+` combines a dimensionless value with
a length. **SysML v2 §9.8.9.1** requires the operands and the result of an
addition to share a quantity dimension, so the published expression is not
satisfiable under any reading, and the evident intent — a radius in millimetres —
is the parenthesised form. OpenSysML's warning at that line
(`operator '+' combines incommensurable quantities`) is therefore a true
positive. The pinned pilot performs no dimensional analysis and is silent both
on the published line and on the corrected one, so the correction changes our
verdict and not the pilot's.

### `1/(2 * Cp) * V^2 + T_static` adds L^6 to Θ (pilot `2026-05`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Published, `Analysis Examples/Turbojet Stage Analysis.sysml`:25:

```sysml
return : TemperatureValue = 1/(2 * Cp) * V^2 + T_static;
```

`V` is declared `VolumeValue` (L^3) and `Cp` `DimensionOneValue`, so the first
operand has dimension L^6 while `T_static` is a `TemperatureValue` (Θ);
**SysML v2 §9.8.9.1** requires both operands and the result of `+` to share a
quantity dimension, and the declared return type Θ agrees with the second
operand only. The physics the calculation names (a total-temperature rise,
`V^2 / (2·Cp)`) wants `V` to be a speed rather than a volume, but the published
model does not say so anywhere: correcting it would mean choosing a type, a
unit and a dimension on the example's behalf.

So this row is **documented without a correction**. The overlay carries it for
provenance only; both figures every oracle reports keep the published text, and
OpenSysML's warning at that line stays in the differential census.

### `return a : AccelerationValue = tp * dt * tp` returns L^4·M^2·T^-5 (pilot `2026-07`)

**Not filed.** Drafted here for a maintainer to authorise; nothing has been
posted upstream.

Published, `Analysis Examples/Dynamics.sysml`:13, in `calc def Acceleration`
whose parameters are `in dt : TimeValue; in tm : MassValue; in tp: PowerValue`:

```sysml
return a : AccelerationValue = tp * dt * tp;
```

The file imports `ISQ::*`, whose definitions fix every dimension involved:
`AccelerationValue` declares `:>> mRef: AccelerationUnit[1]` and
`AccelerationUnit`'s power factors are L^1 and T^-2; `PowerValue` declares
`:>> mRef: PowerUnit[1]`, whose factors are L^2, M^1 and T^-3; and `TimeValue`
is `alias TimeValue for DurationValue`, T^1. The published product is therefore
(L^2·M·T^-3)^2 · T = L^4·M^2·T^-5, while **KerML 7.4.9** makes that expression
the value of the return feature, which answers to the `AccelerationValue` the
same line declares. The two dimensions are incommensurable, so the model is
unsatisfiable as published.

No correction is derivable. Acceleration from power is `tp / (tm * v)`, but this
calculation declares no speed among its parameters and its unused `tm` cannot
alone repair the exponents — `tp * dt / tm` is L^2·T^-2, not L·T^-2. Two of the
three plausible repairs also change the caller's contract, so the entry is
**documented without a correction** and the published text is what every oracle
reads.

The pinned pilot performs no dimensional analysis and is silent on the line, so
this is a diagnostic OpenSysML raises alone
(`cannot bind a value of dimension L^4·M^2·T^-5 to a feature typed by
AccelerationValue (dimension L·T^-2)`).

Earlier in the same file, at line 9, `calc def Power` has a second defect of the
same family that OpenSysML does **not** report:

```sysml
return tp : PowerValue = whlpwr - Cd * v - Cf * tm * v;
```

`whlpwr` is a `PowerValue` (L^2·M·T^-3), `Cd` and `Cf` are `Real`, `v` a
`SpeedValue` (L·T^-1) and `tm` a `MassValue`, so the three subtraction operands
have dimensions L^2·M·T^-3, L·T^-1 and M·L·T^-1 — which **SysML v2 §9.8.9.1**
requires to agree. The static dimensional check judges no product, by the
[documented design](spec-compliance.md), so no warning is raised here and the
overlay declares no entry for it either: an overlay entry covers one line per
file, and line 13 is the line an oracle reports. It is recorded here because a
report about this file should name both.

### `fuelConsumption : FuelEconomyAnalysis_1` redefines an action typed by `FuelConsumption` (pilot `2026-05`, fixed at `2026-07`)

**Never filed, and now closed.** The `2026-07` corpus publishes
`individual action :>> fuelConsumption : FuelConsumption_1` — the reading derived
below — so the overlay entry was retired and this section is kept as the record
of the finding.

Published at `2026-05`, `Individuals Examples/AnalysisIndividualExample.sysml`:86:

```sysml
individual action :>> fuelConsumption : FuelEconomyAnalysis_1 {
```

Corrected by the overlay, and published as such since `2026-07`:

```sysml
individual action :>> fuelConsumption : FuelConsumption_1 {
```

The redefined feature is `action fuelConsumption : FuelConsumption` of
`FuelEconomyAnalysis`, and **KerML 7.4.9** and **8.3.4.2** make a redefinition a
subsetting, whose subsetting feature's type must conform to the subsetted one's.
`FuelEconomyAnalysis_1` is the individual *analysis* definition specializing the
enclosing `FuelEconomyAnalysis`, so it conforms to nothing that `FuelConsumption`
specializes and the published model is unsatisfiable. Two lines above, the same
file declares `individual action def FuelConsumption_1 :> FuelConsumption` and
never mentions it again: the individual counterpart of the redefined feature's
type, which is what line 86 evidently meant to name. Substituting it clears our
error and leaves the rest of the file's verdict unchanged.

The pinned pilot validates subsetting conformance nowhere, so it is silent on
both texts, and the correction changes our verdict and not the pilot's.

## Proposed specification issue: identity annotations in the textual notation

**Filed** (maintainer-approved, 2026-09-01) against the **SysML 2.0** specification
(the textual-notation clauses, formal/26-03-02) as
[INBOX-2510](https://issues.omg.org/browse/INBOX-2510) — a temporary key that
redirects to the permanent one once the issue is assigned to a task force. The design
this draft distills is
[element-identity-annotations.md](element-identity-annotations.md); the working
prototype is OpenSysML's `IdentityMetadata` library, its validation pass, and the
RDF round trip. The body below is the submission text.

````markdown
**Title:** Textual notation cannot carry element identity, severing round trips
with the repositories the specification's own API defines

**Nature:** request for enhancement (interchange gap). **Severity:** significant.

The textual notation deliberately omits `Element::elementId`: text is treated as a
projection, and identity as the repository's concern. But the notation is the form
engineers version, diff and review, and the Systems Modeling API and Services
specification addresses every element by that id. The combination severs round
trips: any tool that serializes a model to text and reads it back has lost the
correlation with the repository it came from, so a rename — same element, new
name — is indistinguishable from a delete plus a create. Implementations are
already inventing workarounds (sidecar mapping files, IRI conventions, comment
conventions), none of which survive interchange through another conforming tool.

**Proposal:** standardize identity annotations — either a normative metadata
library, or dedicated surface syntax if the taskforce prefers. A minimal library
form, implementable today because user-defined metadata is already conforming
notation:

```sysml
standard library package IdentityMetadata {
    metadata def ElementId {
        attribute id : ScalarValues::String;
    }
    metadata def ProjectRef {
        attribute projectId : ScalarValues::String;
        attribute branch : ScalarValues::String[0..1];
        attribute org : ScalarValues::String[0..1];
    }
}
```

Applied opt-in: `@ElementId { id = "8f3a41d0-…"; }` on an element pins its
repository identity; one `@ProjectRef` on the root namespace binds the document to
a project (branch selecting a version, never contributing to identity). Elements
without an annotation keep tool-derived identity, so unannotated models are
unaffected and annotation cost is paid only where correlation matters.

**Implementation experience:** OpenSysML (github.com/Open-MBEE/OpenSysML)
implements exactly this shape: the metadata library, a validation pass (duplicate
and malformed ids, project-scope conflicts), RDF export keyed by the effective id,
and reader re-materialization closing the notation → RDF → notation round trip
byte-for-byte — all without any specification change, demonstrating that only the
*standardization* of the spelling is missing. Round-trip measurements against a
live Flexo MMS repository are maintained in the project's committed
interoperability report.

Submitted 2026-09-01 via the
[OMG issue reporting form](https://issues.omg.org/issues/create-new-issue); the
key above updates once a task force takes the issue.

## Proposed specification issue: diagram layout in the textual notation

**Drafted, not filed.** Against the **SysML 2.0** specification (the textual-notation
clauses, formal/26-03-02, and the graphical-notation clause 7.27 that treats a diagram
as a projection with no persisted geometry). The design this draft distills is
[diagram-layout-annotations.md](diagram-layout-annotations.md); the working prototype
is OpenSysML's `DiagramLayout` library, the geometry it carries through the view
engine, and its validation pass. The body below is the draft submission text.

````markdown
**Title:** Textual notation cannot carry diagram layout, so a diagram does not
survive a round trip through text

**Nature:** request for enhancement (interchange gap). **Severity:** significant.

The graphical notation is defined as a projection of the model, and neither the
textual notation nor the Systems Modeling API and Services specification has a
place for where a diagram draws an element. A model kept in text therefore has no
diagrams of its own: every rendering is laid out afresh, a diagram arranged in one
tool loses its arrangement when the model is exchanged as text, and a
reorganized diagram is invisible in a review of the change. Implementations keep
positions in tool-specific sidecars (per-tool diagram files, IRI conventions,
comment conventions), none of which another conforming tool reads.

**Proposal:** standardize a per-view layout vocabulary as a normative metadata
library — implementable today, since user-defined metadata is already conforming
notation — or as dedicated surface syntax if the taskforce prefers. A minimal
library form:

```sysml
standard library package DiagramLayout {
    metadata def Layout {
        attribute x : ScalarValues::Real;
        attribute y : ScalarValues::Real;
        attribute width : ScalarValues::Real[0..1];
        attribute height : ScalarValues::Real[0..1];
        attribute collapsed : ScalarValues::Boolean[0..1];
    }
    metadata def Route {
        attribute points : ScalarValues::Real[0..*] ordered nonunique;
    }
    metadata def Canvas {
        attribute unit : ScalarValues::String[0..1];
        attribute width : ScalarValues::Real[0..1];
        attribute height : ScalarValues::Real[0..1];
    }
}
```

Applied per view and opt-in: `metadata Layout about engine { x = 120; y = 80; }`
in a view's body places the element in that view; `@Layout { … }` in an element's
own body is the position every view that does not place it falls back to;
`Route` gives the edge a connection, transition, succession or flow is drawn as
its waypoints; `Canvas` in a view body sizes the drawing surface. Coordinates are
pixels from the top-left corner, y downward. Elements without an annotation are
laid out by the tool as today, so unannotated models are unaffected.

**Implementation experience:** OpenSysML (github.com/Open-MBEE/OpenSysML)
implements this shape: the metadata library, resolution of the effective
position per (view, element) pair from the view's body before the element's own
annotation, the geometry carried through its view engine to every rendering it
produces (as structured fields over its language-server render method, and kept
visible as comments and suffixes in Mermaid and text output), and a validation
pass (an annotation on an element the view's rendering does not draw, an odd
waypoint list, a canvas outside a view, two positions for one element in one
view) — all without any specification change, demonstrating that only the
*standardization* of the spelling is missing.
